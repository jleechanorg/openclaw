# Sandbox Disabled

## Configuration Change

Sandbox mode has been disabled for full functionality:

```json
"sandbox": {
  "mode": "off",
  "workspaceAccess": "rw"
}
```

## Reason

- Personal machine (single user)
- Need full GitHub integration
- Need custom script execution
- safeBins provides basic protection

## Benefits

- ✅ All safeBins commands work via MCP
- ✅ Predictable behavior (no random blocks)
- ✅ Full development workflow

## Security

- safeBins acts as alow-list
- 43 approved commands only
- Monitored by user
