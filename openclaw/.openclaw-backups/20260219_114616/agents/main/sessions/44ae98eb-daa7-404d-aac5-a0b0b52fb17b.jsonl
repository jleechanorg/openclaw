The user has set up a periodic reminder to review something called \"P\" every 10 minutes until acknowledged.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the project context, it says:\n\"# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\"\n\nBut this is a cron job, not a heartbeat. The message is: \"[cron:f44e55e8-2af2-4e8a-91c3-4d64842eceb0 review-p-every-10m] 🔔 Reminder: Review P (every 10 min until ack)\"\n\nThis is asking me to review something called \"P\". I should check if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to - it could be a file, a project, a pull request, etc.\n\nI don't have any additional context about what \"P\" is. This appears to be a cron reminder but I don't have information about what needs to be reviewed.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n- \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\"\n\nBut I don't know what \"P\" is or what reviewing it entails. I should ask for clarification about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The cron message says \"until ack\" - meaning it will keep sending this every 10 minutes until I acknowledge it. But I need to understand what \"P\" is to do anything useful with it.\n\nI should reply asking for clarification about what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"ffcf146317acbe0e0603ec19c123fc7dafbaa0f778e2e0caf77975a24084beab"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to \"Review P\" but I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
