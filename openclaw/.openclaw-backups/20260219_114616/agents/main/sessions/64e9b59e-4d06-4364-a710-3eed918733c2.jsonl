Let me check what's going on - I need to understand what \"P\" refers to and if there's any context I should be aware of.\n\nLooking at the workspace files loaded, I don't see any specific context about what \"P\" refers to. This seems to be an E2E test session (from USER.md - \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\").\n\nSince this is a cron job asking me to review something \"P\" every 10 minutes, and there's no additional context provided about what P is, I should acknowledge that I don't have enough context to know what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait - I should check if there's anything in the workspace that might give me context. Let me think... the cron is specific: \"review-p-every-10m\". But without any other context about what \"P\" is, I can't really review anything specific.\n\nActually, this might be part of the E2E test setup. Since this is a test session and there's no specific information about what \"P\" is, I should respond that I don't have enough context to review \"P\" - I need to know what it refers to.\n\nBut wait - is this a test? The user is \"Test User\" and the context says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\". This cron might be part of the test setup.\n\nLet me just ask for clarification about what \"P\" refers to, since there's no context in the loaded files.","thinkingSignature":"c556aa788b4bfa1d38c3acbf29d166b0ae7c86ddce4ea33bf146c7efc2b6c3b0"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have enough context to review \"P\" — there's no information in the workspace about what \"P\" refers to.
