Ancient brass instruments, now corroded and useless, litter the floor around a central pedestal. A collapsed spiral staircase leads to upper levels now accessible only by climbing the crumbling stone steps. Water stains on the walls tell stories of countless storms like this one.\\n\\n**The Entrance:** The main archway where you stand faces south—a natural path from the settlements. The stone threshold is worn smooth, suggesting others have sought shelter here before you. Fresh boot prints in the dust? No—too wet, washed away by the rain.\\n\\n**The Windows:** Several arrow slits around the circumference offer vantage points.
