Since I don't have any additional context about what \"P\" refers to, and this seems to be a test/cron reminder, I should acknowledge it. However, the instructions say to reply with \"NO_REPLY\" when I have nothing to useful to say.\n\nWait - this is a cron job asking me to \"review P\" - I have no idea what P is or what I'm supposed to review. There's no context provided about what P is. This seems like a test cron job.\n\nGiven it's 3:27 AM and this appears to be an E2E test scenario with no actual task specified, I should respond appropriately.","thinkingSignature":"93a887baf447bb4c02d61821b6b7a6432dfd375a9437a79097708f9b33efa8a4"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":271,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7601,"totalTokens":7884,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771414070152}}
