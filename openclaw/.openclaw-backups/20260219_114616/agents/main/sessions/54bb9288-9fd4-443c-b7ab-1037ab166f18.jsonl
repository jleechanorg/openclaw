This seems like a test message or heartbeat poll. Let me check the context - I see HEARTBEAT.md has a reminder for 5:00 PM review of Cindil's cover letter, but there's no specific action 0 instruction.\n\nLooking at my instructions, I should check if this matches the heartbeat prompt. The heartbeat prompt says: \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n\n\"Action 0\" doesn't match the heartbeat prompt exactly. This seems like a test message. Since there's nothing specific to act on and it doesn't match the heartbeat pattern, I should respond appropriately.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - \"Action 0\" could be a simple test message. Since I have no specific task to perform and this doesn't appear to be a heartbeat, I should respond normally or ask what they'd like help with.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. This appears to be an E2E test context (from USER.md: \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"). \"Action 0\" might be part of a test sequence. \n\nGiven this is likely a test scenario, I should respond appropriately. Since there's no clear action requested and this seems like a test message, I'll respond concisely.","thinkingSignature":"fef17ba63d17b7df49ff279318414b4374bbfb541cbadff19628e9d88c58cf7d"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Ready for action.
