They've provided:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nThis is a character creation session. I need to follow the character_creation_instruction.md which says:\n1. I should NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. I need to provide choices in every response\n3. I should show the campaign summary first\n\nLooking at the character_prompt, it seems like the player has already provided character details. Let me present this for review following the \"God Mode Template Review\" section of the character creation instructions.\n\nActually, re-reading - they provided \"Character:\", \"Setting:\", \"Description:\" - this looks like they want me to generate a character based on these prompts. Let me check the three options:\n1. AI Generated - Let AI create based on theme\n2. Standard D&D - Traditional step-by-step\n3. Custom Class\n\nGiven they provided a character concept, I should present this as an AI-generated character for review, with the choice to edit or start the game.\n\nWait - let me re-read the character_creation_instruction.md more carefully. It says for god mode templates (pre-populated characters), I should present for review with exactly two choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\".\n\nBut this doesn't seem like a pre-populated character - it looks like a prompt for character creation. Let me provide the standard three options for creation method.\n\nActually, looking at the user's input more carefully:\n- \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" - this is the character concept\n- \"Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\" - world/setting\n- \"Description: Browser test campaign\" - campaign description\n\nThis appears to be the player's prompt for what they want. I should acknowledge this and start the creation flow by presenting the three method options.\n\nLet me format a response following the character creation protocol.","thinkingSignature":"10d6cb6ca12c3b4fbd8c0ceaaac9925c4965f10ab3d90a4f0dfa5cc78b5f83e9"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_ukcakniszpt5_1","name":"write","arguments":{"content":"# Test Character Creation Session\n\n## Session Info\n- **Date:** 2025-01-31\n- **Purpose:** Browser E2E test - character creation flow\n- **User Input Character:** Curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- **Setting:** Quiet library with ancient tomes\n- **Campaign:** Browser test\n\n## History\n- Initial character creation request received\n","file_path":"/Users/jleechan/memory/2025-01-31.md"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":537,"cacheRead":69909,"cacheWrite":137,"totalTokens":70595,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771498272925}}
