They've provided:\n- game_mode: \"character\" \n- A character prompt: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: Browser test campaign\"\n- No existing game_state (empty)\n- generate_companions: false\n- use_default_world: false\n\nThis is the start of character creation. According to the character creation instruction, I need to:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Use the [CHARACTER CREATION - <stage>] tag in narrative\n\nLooking at the character_prompt provided, it seems like this might be a template-style character that's been partially defined. Let me check - there's no player_character_data in the game_state, so this is a fresh start.\n\nThe prompt gives me:\n- Character concept: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n- Setting: \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n- Description: \"Browser test campaign\"\n\nWait - looking at the character_creation_instruction.md, when there's a pre-populated character (like from a template), I should present it for review. But there's no player_character_data in game_state, so this isn't a pre-populated character - it's a concept/prompt for me to work with.\n\nActually, wait - the \"character_prompt\" field contains what looks like template-style information. Let me re-read the instructions...\n\nFrom character_creation_instruction.md:\n\"When you receive a **pre-populated character** from a campaign template:\n- `player_character_data` contains full character (name, race, class, stats, equipment)\n- Character is COMPLETE and READY\"\n\nBut here, game_state is empty {} - there's no player_character_data. So this is NOT a pre-populated template - it's a character concept/prompt that the user has provided, and I need to guide them through creating the character.\n \nI'll design a three-step approach to build this scholar character. First, I'll use AI generation to quickly create a character matching their prompt. Then I'll review the generated character details, and finally offer editing options. The AI generation will help rapidly develop a scholar archetype seeking forgotten knowledge in an ancient library setting.","thinkingSignature":"c934fb399c30af2e8172aa67d826043a59cd4241b043f6208df657a1d45b4ebe"},{"type":"text","text":"{\"session_header\":\"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: Browser Test Mode\\nLocation: Character Creation\\nStatus: Creating New Character\",\"narrative\":\"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\\n\\nI see you'd like to create a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge, set in a quiet library filled with ancient tomes.
