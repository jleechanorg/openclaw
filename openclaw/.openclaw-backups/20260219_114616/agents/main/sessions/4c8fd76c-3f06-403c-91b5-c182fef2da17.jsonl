Let me check the HEARTBEAT.md file to see what needs attention.\n\nLooking at my context, I see HEARTBEAT.md has:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nBut it's currently 8:27 AM, not 5:00 PM. The cron message mentions \"review-p-every-10m\" which suggests there's something specific about \"P\" that needs reviewing every 10 minutes.\n\nLet me check if there's more context about what \"P\" refers to. This seems to be a test session (E2E test for character creation). The cron is asking me to review \"P\" - this could be:\n1. A placeholder for something specific in the test\n2. A task that needs periodic review\n\nSince this appears to be an E2E test session and I don't have clear information about what \"P\" refers to in this context, I should respond with HEARTBEAT_OK if nothing specific needs attention, or clarify what needs to be reviewed.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - this is a cron reminder with ID \"review-p-every-10m\" which suggests it's a test reminder. The user is Test User running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation. \n\nThere's nothing in HEARTBEAT.md that matches \"review-p\" - only a 5 PM reminder for a cover letter.\n\nGiven this is likely a test cron and there's no specific action required that I can determine, I should reply HEARTBEAT_OK.","thinkingSignature":"e7e01134ac49984dc57beff2b0df88b0f0d219532117da84ce98fbf304ebe79c"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":340,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7295,"totalTokens":7647,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771518470347}}
