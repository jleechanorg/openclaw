The context says this is an E2E test for character creation. But the user's message \"I inspect the ruins for traps\" seems like they're already in-game and playing.\n\nLet me think about what to do:\n1. This could be a test to see how I respond in character\n2. This could be the user actually wanting to play a game\n3. This could be testing some game mechanics\n\nSince this is described as an \"E2E test for OpenClaw character creation,\" I should probably respond as if this is part of testing the character creation/gameplay flow. But I don't have clear context about what character they're playing or what game system this is.\n\nI should respond in character as a game master or narrator, describing what happens when they inspect the ruins. This seems like reasonable behavior for testing a game platform.\n\nLet me craft a response that:\n1. Describes what happens when they inspect the ruins\n2. Asks what they find (letting them drive the story)\n3. Keeps it brief and actionable\n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider. This appears to be a test message. The USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and \"Testing the OpenClaw platform integration - character creation flow E2E test.\"\n\nThis might just be a test to see how I handle a simple action. \n\nI'll respond as the game narrator, presenting the scene and asking what they discover. I'll keep it concise and action-oriented, giving them room to explore and describe their findings.","thinkingSignature":"537ee175e1c7fb9c9bd25cacfd0f208cbed6d8d1371839cd7404d151e4883e8d"},{"type":"text","text":"You carefully examine the ancient ruins, running your eyes along the cracked stone walls and debris-littered floor.
