This is a character creation request for E2E testing\n2. The user has provided a character prompt: \"Character: A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\"\n3. The game_mode is \"character\" - so this is character creation mode\n4. The game_state is empty - no character exists yet\n5. world_data is empty - no world content\n\nAccording to the character_creation_instruction.md, I need to:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character creation only\n2. Provide choices for how to create the character\n3. Include the mandatory \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" choice\n\nThe prompt gives me a character concept: \"A hero\" in \"A small room\" with description \"Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\".\n\nI should follow the character creation flow from character_creation_instruction.md:\n\n**Phase 1: Concept (What kind of character?)**\n- Offer three creation methods:\n  - ai_generated: \"AI Generated\" - Let AI create a character based on theme\n  - standard_dnd: \"Standard D&D\" - Traditional step-by-step creation\n  - custom_class: \"Custom Class\" - Design a custom class\n\nSince the user has provided a character prompt (\"A hero\"), I can use that as the basis for an AI-generated character.\n\nBut wait - the user has already provided a character prompt which suggests they want an AI-generated character. However, I should still present the three options as per the protocol.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the prompt provided: \"Character: A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\" - this seems like a concept description that could be used for AI generation.\n\nLet me present the three options as required, but I can acknowledge the user's provided prompt in my response.","thinkingSignature":"905eca0a3f93554353ed8634e96c6a92d5a76c0b071752969960c27b80852ca2"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_bcpto3732d9h_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"character creation flow E2E test"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":430,"cacheRead":1626,"cacheWrite":68086,"totalTokens":70154,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771397517922}}
