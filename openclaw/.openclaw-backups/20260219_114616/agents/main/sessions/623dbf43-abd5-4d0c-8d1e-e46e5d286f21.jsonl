But wait - I have no context about what room, what setting, or what character. This seems like a test message.\n\nLet me check if there's any other context I should be aware of. The USER.md says this is \"E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" - so this might just be a test input.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully - this appears to be a test session. The USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and \"Testing the OpenClaw platform integration - character creation flow E2E test.\"\n\nSince this is an E2E test and the user just said \"I look around the room\" without any other context, I should probably respond appropriately as a GM would - describing the environment. But I have no details about what room or setting.\n\nActually, I should just respond naturally as I would in a GM role.
