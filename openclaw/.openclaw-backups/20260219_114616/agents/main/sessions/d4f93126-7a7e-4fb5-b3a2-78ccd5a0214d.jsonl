There are no other files providing adventure details. \n\nI should respond in a way that acknowledges their action and potentially asks for clarification or continues the narrative - but I need to be careful not to assume too much. Since this appears to be an E2E test context (per USER.md), this might be testing some game functionality.\n\nLet me respond naturally to the player's action, either asking for clarification about what game/setting this is, or if there's context I'm missing. Actually, wait - I should check if there's any additional context I might be missing. The user is clearly in some kind of game/adventure context but I don't have details about what game, setting, or current situation.\n\nI should ask what game/setting this is, or acknowledge their action and ask for more context about the scene.","thinkingSignature":"5bb7a07b99cecb755b70763b1fc3cc1a4c97f32eee15c0b1613fb990c4c13a2e"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have context about what ruins you're inspecting or what game system we're using.
