Looking at the game state, I'm in character creation mode with `character_creation_stage: \"concept\"`.\n\nThe user_action says: \"Say hello in one short sentence.\"\n\nAccording to the character creation instructions, I should NOT start the story - this is a \"pause menu\" for character building. However, the user has sent a simple greeting action.\n\nWait - let me re-read the instructions. The character creation mode says \"Do NOT start the story.

But the previous response from \"gemini\" just said \"[Character Creation Mode - Story begins after character is complete]\" without any choices or options.\n\nAccording to AGENTS.md character creation instructions:\n- Phase 1: Concept - Offer three creation methods: ai_generated, standard_dnd, custom_class\n- I need to provide choices in every response\n- Must include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as last choice\n\nThe user said \"Say hello in one short sentence\" - this seems like they're trying to test the basic chat.
