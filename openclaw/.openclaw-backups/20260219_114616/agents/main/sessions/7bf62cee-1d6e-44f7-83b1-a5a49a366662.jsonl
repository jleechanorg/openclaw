I should respond in character as the GM, describing what their character sees in the room. Since this is an E2E test and they mentioned \"scholar in a library setting\" in MEMORY.md, I'll describe a scholarly/library-type room.\n\nActually, wait - I need to check if this is a test input or if I should be responding as the GM in a game context.
