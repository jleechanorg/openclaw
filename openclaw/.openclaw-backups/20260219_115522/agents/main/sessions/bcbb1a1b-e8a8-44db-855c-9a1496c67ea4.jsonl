Let me check what this is about by looking at the workspace context and any relevant files.\n\nThe reminder says \"review-p-every-10m\" which suggests there's something called \"P\" that needs review. Let me check if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to - it could be a PR, a pull request, a person, or some other task.\n\nLooking at the context provided, there's no specific information about what \"P\" refers to. This seems to be part of an E2E test (based on USER.md mentioning \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\").\n\nThis appears to be a cron job reminder for testing purposes. Since I don't have clear context about what \"P\" refers to, and this seems to be part of an E2E test scenario, I should respond appropriately.\n\nGiven this is a cron job and there's no clear actionable item in my context, and the HEARTBEAT.md says to reply HEARTBEAT_OK when nothing needs attention, I should check if there's something specific to do.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - this is labeled as a cron job with ID \"f44e55e8-2af2-4e8a-91c3-4d64842eceb0\". It says \"review-p-every-10m\" which likely means \"review pull request every 10 minutes\".\n\nGiven this is likely a test scenario and there's no specific PR or other \"P\" item in my context, I should acknowledge but indicate there's nothing to review without more context.\n\nWait - let me re-read the instructions. The cron is asking me to review something called \"P\" every 10 minutes. Without more context, I should ask what \"P\" refers to or indicate I need more information.\n\nBut actually, given this is a test environment and the user is running E2E tests, perhaps this cron is part of the test setup and I should just acknowledge it.","thinkingSignature":"68a5905f5035ee800999f34bca8fea545a2659e775bd7e467e7253bb18314ee8"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
