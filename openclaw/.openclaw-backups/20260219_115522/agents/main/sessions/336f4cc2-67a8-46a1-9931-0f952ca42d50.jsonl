The library is vast, far larger than its modest stone exterior suggests, its corridors branching and folding back on themselves in ways that seem to defy the building's footprint. The air smells of parchment, old leather, and something faintly metallic—like ink left too long in a copper well.\\n\\nAric (Lvl 1) sits at a scarred oak reading table near the center of the main hall, surrounded by a careful arrangement of opened tomes. His longsword leans against the table leg, out of place among the quills and bookmarks, but he has learned that a scholar who ventures into forgotten stacks should never go unarmed. The last three who tried to catalogue the Athenaeum's restricted wing were never seen again—or so the elderly custodian, Brenneth (Lvl 2), likes to remind him every morning.\\n\\nSpeaking of Brenneth—the old man shuffles between the shelves nearby, pushing a rattling cart of returns. He pauses, peers over his half-moon spectacles at Aric, and clears his throat.\\n\\n\\\"You're at it again.\\\" His voice is dry as the pages he tends. \\\"That's the third morning this week I've found you nose-deep in the Tessaran Index. Most folk who come asking about the Veiled Collection lose interest after the first warning.\\\" He sets a leather-bound volume on the cart with deliberate care. \\\"You're either very determined or very foolish. Possibly both.\\\"\\n\\nHe leans closer, lowering his voice. \\\"But since you're still here—I found something last night. Wedged behind a shelf in the east corridor. A journal. Old. Older than most things in this building, and that's saying something.\\\" His rheumy eyes sharpen. \\\"The handwriting matches the marginalia in that index you've been studying. Whoever wrote your annotations... wrote this journal too.\\\"\\n\\nBrenneth straightens, glancing toward the east corridor—a narrow passage between two towering bookshelf rows that disappears into shadow. \\\"It's still where I found it. Didn't want to move it. Didn't want to touch it more than I had to, truth be told.\\\" He rubs his fingers together as though remembering an unpleasant sensation. \\\"The leather felt... warm.\\\"\\n\\nFrom somewhere deep in the library, a sound echoes—soft, rhythmic, like pages turning on their own.\",\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"The adventure begins with two clear hooks: Brenneth's discovery of a mysterious journal connected to the annotations Aric has been studying, and an unexplained sound from deeper in the library.

Brenneth's discomfort suggests the journal may be more than it appears.
