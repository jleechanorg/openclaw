The \"until ack\" aspect is prompting me to deliver the message as a notification, assuming the user simply needs to acknowledge it. I'm leaning toward presenting the reminder, despite the cryptic \"Review P\" term. Given the early hour, and the goal from `SOUL.md`, I'll prioritize delivering the reminder promptly. Before I do, I will also check `MEMORY.md` and any files in `memory/` for additional context about \"Review P\".\n\n\n","thinkingSignature":"44a32ae9f003a96f00d5239e716d8ac385e32283a827b53d0fce1050b03d7bab"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_1kj4cq050gdw_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"\"Review P\" OR \"Project P\""}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":7998,"output":567,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":8565,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771247870342}}
