Let me check what's being referred to - likely something from my memory or workspace context.\n\nLooking at my context, I don't see explicit mention of \"P\" in the loaded files. This might be a test session based on USER.md which says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\".\n\nThe cron message is about reviewing P every 10 minutes. Without more context about what \"P\" refers to, I should check if there's any relevant information in my memory or ask for clarification.\n\nActually, looking at the message format, this appears to be a test cron job. The \"review-p-every-10m\" suggests it's a periodic reminder task. Since this is an E2E test session and I don't have specific information about what \"P\" refers to in the current context, I should acknowledge this is a test cron and respond appropriately.\n\nWait - the instructions say for heartbeats: \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\" But I don't know what \"P\" refers to. This seems like a test cron for the platform itself.\n\nGiven this is an E2E test session and the reminder references \"P\" which isn't defined in my context, this is likely a platform test. I should respond indicating I don't have enough context about what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"cb1cb4f6b0d1b4213f2d067fb4014ba824a3f115acd31239268e5265cbf1299f"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have enough context about what \"P\" refers to.
