Let me proceed with the character creation as instructed.\n\nThe user has provided:\n- Character concept: Curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- This is for an OpenClaw browser lifecycle test\n\nAccording to AGENTS.md, I need to present the three creation options. Since there's no pre-existing character, I'll guide through the manual creation flow starting with Phase 1: Concept.\n\nWait - the character concept is already provided. Let me check if there's already character data. The game_state is empty, so this is a fresh start.\n\nBut wait - the user has given me a character prompt with specific details. According to my instructions in AGENTS.md:\n\n\"**IMPORTANT**: Don't ask the user to create a character from scratch - it's already created! Just present it for review.\"\n\nBut looking at the input, there's NO player_character_data in game_state - it's empty {}. So this is NOT a pre-made character template. It's a character concept/prompt.\n\nSo I should follow the manual creation flow:\n1. Phase 1: Concept - they've given me the concept\n2. Phase 2: Mechanics - build the character\n3. Phase 3: Personality (optional)\n4. Phase 4: Completion\n\nSince the concept is already provided, I should move to Phase 2: Mechanics and offer the three creation methods.\n\nActually, re-reading more carefully - the user has given me a \"character_prompt\" which describes what kind of character they want. This is different from a pre-built character. So I should offer the three creation methods so they can build it.\n\nLet me present the options.","thinkingSignature":"45e07cfc1d47effce435bb459718a70b6260b2af9eb4fc3c620eea7d50aa2a46"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a **Curious Scholar** seeking forgotten knowledge, set in a quiet library filled with ancient tomes. \n\nNow let's build your character.
