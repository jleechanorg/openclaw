Let me analyze what I need to do:\n\n1. This is character creation mode (game_mode: \"character\")\n2. I have character details provided in `character_prompt`\n3. The player seems to want me to create this character\n\nAccording to the character creation instructions in AGENTS.md and the project context:\n- I should present the character for review (since there's a specific character prompt provided)\n- Use tag: `[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]`\n- Ask for confirmation\n- Provide exactly two choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nLet me generate a character based on the prompt and present it for review. The prompt says:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nI should create a scholar-type character - probably a Wizard or perhaps a Knowledge Cleric, or maybe a Rogue with scholarly tendencies. Given the \"seeking forgotten knowledge\" and library setting, a Wizard makes the most sense.\n\nLet me create a level 1 character with:\n- Race: Probably Human or maybe Elf (for the long life to seek knowledge)\n- Class: Wizard (scholar of arcane knowledge)\n- Background: Sage (fits the scholarly theme)\n\nActually, I should follow the flow - the user has provided a character concept. I should present it for review as a pre-made character template.\n\nWait - looking at the character_prompt more carefully, it seems like this is a character IDEA, not a fully created character. The prompt says \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" - this is describing what kind of character they want.\n\nAccording to the instructions, I should:\n1. Present the character for review (show name, race, class, abilities, equipment)\n2. Ask for confirmation\n3. Provide exactly two choices: Edit Character and Finish Character Creation and Start Game\n\n\nI'll generate a complete character from the concept: Caelum Ashford, a Human Wizard (Sage), with stats built using the standard array and appropriate equipment for a scholarly mage.","thinkingSignature":"b8b0ea2357a89651882114282e671e3c63059506617a603a57f0cf13f57a5c51"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]\n\nHere's the character created from your prompt:\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Caelum Ashford (Lvl 1 Human Wizard)\n\n**Race:** Human\n\n**Class:** Wizard (School of Divination)\n\n**Background:** Sage\n\n**Ability Scores:**\n- STR 10 (+0)\n- DEX 12 (+1)\n- CON 14 (+2)\n- INT 16 (+3)\n- WIS 13 (+1)\n- CHA 10 (+0)\n\n**Hit Points:** 8\n\n**Armor Class:** 10\n\n**Equipment:**\n- Quarterstaff\n- Component Pouch\n- Scholar's Pack\n- Spellbook (blank)\n- 2 Gold Pieces\n\n**Spells Known:** Mage Hand, Light, Message, Minor Illusion, Prestidigitation, Detect Magic, Identify, Sleep\n\n**Personality:** Caelum is driven by an insatiable curiosity about the world's lost secrets.
