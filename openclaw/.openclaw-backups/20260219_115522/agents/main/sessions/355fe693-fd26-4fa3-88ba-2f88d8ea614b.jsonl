Since there's nothing specific in HEARTBEAT.md that matches \"Review P\", and this seems to be a cron test, I should respond with HEARTBEAT_OK since nothing from HEARTBEAT.md requires attention right now.\n\nActually, wait - the HEARTBEAT.md shows a reminder for 5:00 PM, and it's currently 9:17 AM.
