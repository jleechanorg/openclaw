This appears to be a cron reminder that was set up separately. The reminder is asking to review \"P\" - which likely refers to something in the workspace.\n\nLet me check what \"P\" might refer to. I should look at what's in the workspace or any pending items. Without more context, I should acknowledge this and ask what \"P\" refers to since it's not clear from the context.\n\nActually, wait - let me re-read. The cron is \"review-p-every-10m\" - so it's specifically about reviewing something called \"P\". I don't have enough context to know what \"P\" is. I should ask the user what they'd like me to review.","thinkingSignature":"1550428077934f61d87c5a1f9574718a49fea21a356dd35b2bea16602deac103"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have context on what \"P\" refers to.
