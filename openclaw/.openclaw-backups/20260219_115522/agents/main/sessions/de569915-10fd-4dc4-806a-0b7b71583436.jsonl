Looking at the input:\n\n1. The user said \"Start Adventure\" as their action\n2. The current state shows the character \"Aric\" is in the Restricted Archives of \"The Athenaeum of Forgotten Scrolls\"\n3. There's a planning_block with 4 choices from the previous response\n\nWait - looking at the sequence, the last response (sequence_id 6) was from gemini with the Restricted Archives description and the planning_block. The user then said \"Start Adventure\" which seems to be a response to the character creation prompt, not the current scene.\n\nBut actually, looking more carefully:\n- sequence_id 4: gemini describes the library, introduces the quest\n- sequence_id 5: user says \"Explore the Restricted Archives\"\n- sequence_id 6: gemini describes entering the Restricted Archives, gives planning_block with 4 options\n- Now the user says \"Start Adventure\" \n\nThis is confusing. The user might be:\n1. Selecting one of the planning choices implicitly\n2. Just saying \"Start Adventure\" to begin the adventure (which would mean choosing an option)\n\nGiven the context and that there's no explicit choice selected from the planning_block, I think \"Start Adventure\" is the user essentially saying \"I'm ready to proceed\" - likely meaning they want to continue from where they left off in the Restricted Archives.\n\nActually wait - let me re-read. The user_action says \"Start Adventure\" - this is what the user sent as their message. But we've already started the adventure - they're in the Restricted Archives.\n\nI think the most reasonable interpretation is that the user wants to proceed with the adventure. Since they're in the Restricted Archives and have 4 options presented, and they said \"Start Adventure\", I'll interpret this as them choosing to begin exploring/advancing.\n\nGiven the atmosphere (eerie, warning scratched, missing books), I should continue the narrative naturally. The most engaging approach would be to have them start investigating - perhaps examining the gap/warning makes sense as a natural next step.\n\n\nI'll prepare a JSON response that advances the story, focusing on the mysterious warning in the archives. I'll craft a narrative that explores the intriguing scratched message while maintaining the suspenseful atmosphere of the Restricted Archives.","thinkingSignature":"7b14e362b7fd60702abe43886b1ad485632622939d7ac03f32f981bf9b6aee80"},{"type":"text","text":"{\"session_header\":\"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: 1492 DR, Mirtul 15, 08:05:00\\nLocation: The Athenaeum of Forgotten Scrolls - Restricted Archives\\nStatus: Lvl 1 Fighter | HP: 12/12 | XP: 0/300 | Gold: 10gp\",\"resources\":\"HD: 1/1, Rage: 0/0, Potions: 0/0, Exhaustion: 0\",\"narrative\":\"Morning (08:05:00) in the Restricted Archives—your eyes remain fixed on the unfinished warning etched into the shelf. \\\"DON'T TRUST—\\\" The words cut off abruptly, as if whoever wrote it was interrupted... or feared completion.\\n\\nYou run a finger along the scratched letters, feeling the grooves deeper than casual scratching.
