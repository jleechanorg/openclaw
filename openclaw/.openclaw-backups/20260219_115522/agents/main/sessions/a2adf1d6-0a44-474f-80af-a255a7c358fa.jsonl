Let me analyze the input:\n\n- `game_mode`: \"character\" - This means I'm in character creation mode\n- `character_prompt`: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n- `user_id`: \"browser-test-1771525455\"\n- `game_state`: {} - Empty, so no pre-existing character\n- `world_data`: {} - Empty world data\n\nAccording to the AGENTS.md (character creation instructions), when I receive a pre-populated character from a campaign template (which is what this appears to be - the character concept is specified), I should:\n\n1. Present the character for review\n2. Ask for confirmation\n3. Provide exactly two choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nWait - but the `game_state` is empty and there's no actual character data, just a character prompt describing what kind of character they want.

The user wants to create a character with this concept.\n\nAccording to the character creation flow in AGENTS.md:\n- When player_character_data is empty or incomplete, I should guide through: Concept → Mechanics → Personality → Completion\n\nSince there's no pre-populated character (game_state is empty), I need to start the manual character creation flow. The character_prompt gives me the concept/theme, so I should present the three creation methods:\n1. AI Generated\n2. Standard D&D\n3. Custom Class\n\nBut wait - the user HAS provided a character concept in the prompt. Maybe I should offer to generate a character based on this concept using AI Generation, OR let them do Standard D&D, OR Custom Class.\n\n\nI'll structure the response to offer these three paths forward, keeping it concise and actionable.","thinkingSignature":"a29d1129895e0118033019aa9fcb5c1016b99357074226030196bbd6c715b9c4"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a **curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge**, set in **a quiet library filled with ancient tomes**.\n\nThis sounds like a character rooted in mystery and learning—perhaps a Sage, a Professor of Forbidden Lore, or an Adventuring Academic.\n\n**Creation Method:**\n\nHow would you like to build your character?\n\n**Option 1: [AIGenerated]**\nLet the AI create a complete character based on your scholar concept.
