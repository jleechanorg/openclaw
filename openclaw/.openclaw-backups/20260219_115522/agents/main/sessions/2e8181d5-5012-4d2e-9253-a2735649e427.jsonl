Looking at the story_history:\n- Sequence 1: Character concept created\n- Sequence 2: Character creation concept\n- Sequence 3: \"Start Adventure\" - user clicked this\n- Sequence 4: Gemini started the adventure with narrative\n- Sequence 5: User chose \"Explore the Main Hall\"\n- Sequence 6: Gemini narrated the scene with the mysterious book\n- Sequence 7: User chose \"Examine the Blank Book\"\n- Sequence 8: Gemini described examining the book and introduced the Hexaphrenicon\n\nNow the user_action is \"Start Adventure\" again. This is a bit confusing - but based on the priority_instruction saying to respond to user_action field, NOT story_history...\n\nActually wait - looking at the story_history more carefully:\n- Entry 3: \"Start Adventure\" was the user action that started the story\n- Entry 5: \"Explore the Main Hall\" was user action\n- Entry 7: \"Examine the Blank Book\" was user action\n\nNow entry says user_action: \"Start Adventure\" but that's also what was in sequence_id 3.

The \"Start Adventure\" appears to be repeating, which could indicate:\n1. A test of the game's state management\n2. An unintended double-click\n3. A reset mechanism in the system\n\nThe critical focus now shifts to understanding how to handle this repeated \"Start Adventure\" command while maintaining narrative consistency. I'll need to determine whether this triggers a new story segment or gets filtered out as a duplicate action.\n\nThe character remains positioned in the library, specifically at the Athenaeum of Whispered Tomes, continuing to investigate the Hexaphrenicon. This suggests the repeated action shouldn't disrupt the current narrative progression.\n\nI'll continue the narrative by either:\n1. Proceeding with the examination of the mysterious book\n2. Offering fresh interaction choices\n\nThe narrative should smoothly integrate with the existing scene, avoiding redundant \"Start Adventure\" prompts while maintaining the immersive flow of character exploration.\n\nThe key is matching the user's intent to continue the current adventure context, treating \"Start Adventure\" as a continuation rather than a reset. This means preserving the current location and narrative momentum while providing meaningful interaction opportunities.\n\nI'll craft a response that seamlessly extends the current scene, focusing on the Hexaphrenicon's enigmatic properties and presenting engaging options for the character to investigate further.","thinkingSignature":"aab38b3082b5b6076d0d216a60bfc1dee6779db5ac26ff44820d8ef4833cd1a0"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_5g6y6vnpqnaa_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"OpenClaw character creation browser test campaign"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":701,"cacheRead":1626,"cacheWrite":45070,"totalTokens":47409,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771498761413}}
