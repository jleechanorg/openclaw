Let me analyze what they've provided:\n\n- game_mode: \"character\" \n- character_prompt: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: Browser test campaign\"\n- generate_companions: false\n- Everything else is empty/default\n\nThis is a character creation request. According to my instructions, I need to:\n1. Follow character_creation_instruction.md\n2. NOT start the story - this is meta-game only\n3. ALWAYS provide choices in every response\n4. Include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last choice\n\nLet me check the character_prompt details:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nThis seems like a simple test campaign. I should guide through character creation. Since there's already a character concept provided, I could offer to use that or create from scratch.\n\nActually, looking at the input more carefully - they've provided a character concept but no actual character data. This means I need to start the character creation flow.\n\nAccording to character_creation_instruction.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - offer three methods (AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class)\n- Phase 2: Mechanics\n- Phase 3: Personality (optional)\n- Phase 4: Completion\n\nI should present the three options to the user. Let me format this properly with the required fields.\n\nThe character concept is already provided (\"curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"), so maybe I should offer to use that or let them choose a different approach.\n\nWait - I need to also consider that this is a BROWSER TEST. The character_prompt has all the info needed:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nActually, looking at the prompt more carefully - they've given me the character concept AND setting. \n\nThe user wants to build a scholar character in a library setting for testing purposes. I'll offer them three distinct paths forward: accept an AI-generated scholar based on their description, go through standard D&D character creation, or design something entirely custom. This gives them flexibility while keeping the process straightforward for their browser test.","thinkingSignature":"c85ffa91087e697371e5af362c04ac4995a0e010506afa98988d9e3eeadffcb3"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library setting.
