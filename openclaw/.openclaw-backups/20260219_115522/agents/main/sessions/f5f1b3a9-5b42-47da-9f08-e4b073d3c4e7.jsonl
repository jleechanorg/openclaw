There's some basic equipment in backpack\n\nHowever, I need to check - this appears to be a pre-made character template scenario. According to AGENTS.md:\n\n> When you receive a **pre-populated character** from a campaign template:\n> 1. **Present the character for review**:\n>    - Show character name, race, class, abilities, equipment\n>    - Use tag: `[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]`\n>    - Summarize the character's backstory and abilities\n\nBut the user said \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game - Use a pre-made character template\" - this suggests they want to use a template.\n\nLooking at the current state, the character data is very sparse:\n- Name: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge.\"\n- Description: \"OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n- Equipment: Some basic adventuring gear (backpack, bedroll, mess kit, tinderbox, torch, rations, waterskin, rope, coin pouch)\n\nThis doesn't look like a full pre-made character template - it's missing race, class, stats, etc. The user seems to want me to present options for character creation methods.\n\nActually wait - the user_action says \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game - Use a pre-made character template\" - this sounds like they're choosing an option that says \"Use a pre-made character template\" as the method.\n\nBut looking at the history:\n- Sequence 1: User provided character concept and setting\n- Sequence 2: Gemini asked \"How would you like to create your character?\"\n\nSo the user is now responding to that question with their choice. They want to use a pre-made character template.\n\nBut the game_state shows character_creation_completed: true, which is confusing. \n\nThe state appears to be in an inconsistent condition. Character creation is flagged as complete, yet the character lacks fundamental attributes like race and class. I'll need to either generate a complete character template or seek clarification about whether this is intentional.

The user sent:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"user_action\": \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game - Use a pre-made character template\"\n}\n```\n\nThis is their response to the question \"How would you like to create your character?\"\n\nLooking at the AGENTS.md, it says to offer three methods in Phase 1:\n- AI Generated\n- Standard D&D\n- Custom Class\n\nBut the user's response says \"Use a pre-made character template\" - this seems like they're selecting a 4th option that isn't in my standard list. \n\nHowever, there's also this from AGENTS.md about \"God Mode Template Review\":\n> When you receive a **pre-populated character** from a campaign template:\n> 1. **Present the character for review**\n> 2. **Ask for confirmation**\n> 3. **Provide EXACTLY these two choices**: edit_character or start_adventure\n\nBut the character isn't actually pre-populated - it's just:\n- Name: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge.\"\n- Description: \"OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n- Basic equipment (backpack, bedroll, etc.)\n- No race, class, stats, level\n\nSo I think the user is trying to say they WANT to use a pre-made template, but none is available. The system seems to be in an inconsistent state.\n\nThe most reasonable response is to acknowledge the situation and offer the three standard creation methods. Let me output the correct JSON format.","thinkingSignature":"ffad638e347301536da2a21547684e73f14df84e21f4fbd0b6ab7640a9308228"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a **Curious Scholar** seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library setting.\n\nHow would you like to create your character?\n\n**Note:** The current character data is incomplete (no race, class, or stats).
