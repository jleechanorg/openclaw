Let me analyze the input:\n\n1. **Game mode**: character (character creation mode)\n2. **Character prompt**: \"A practical ranger keeping watch at the frontier. | Setting: A ruined observatory on a stormy night | Description: BYOK and campaign smoke coverage via MCP tooling\"\n3. **generate_companions**: false\n4. **Game state**: empty (new campaign)\n5. **world_data**: empty\n\nThis is a character creation request. According to the character_creation_instruction.md, I need to:\n1. NOT start a story - this is character creation mode\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as an option\n\nThe prompt gives me a character concept (practical ranger) and setting (ruined observatory on stormy night). This seems like they want me to create a character that fits this concept.\n\nLet me start by following the character creation flow:\n- Phase 1: Concept - they already provided a concept (practical ranger)\n- I should ask about the creation method: AIGenerated, StandardDND, or CustomClass\n\nWait, looking at the character_prompt more carefully - it seems like they're providing a detailed concept already. Let me check if this is a template or if they want me to generate based on this.\n\nThe prompt says \"Character: A practical ranger keeping watch at the frontier\" - this reads like they want me to create this specific character. \n\nLooking at the character_creation_instruction.md for god mode templates:\n- \"When you receive a pre-populated character from a campaign template...\"\n\nBut here game_state is empty, so it's not a pre-populated template. This seems like a fresh start with a character concept.\n\nLet me proceed with the standard character creation flow:\n1. First, show the campaign summary\n2. Present the three options: AIGenerated, StandardDND, CustomClass\n3. Since they provided a concept, maybe \"AIGenerated\" fits best - I can generate a ranger based on their description\n\n\n4. I'll present the three creation methods as options for them to choose from.","thinkingSignature":"7dc5a0a2a969ff2b2fd054df6656390591d6601f78db760f95b2182ed5a72a63"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_5j6u65k732v2_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"character creation ranger"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":474,"cacheRead":69556,"cacheWrite":148,"totalTokens":70190,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771307328449}}
