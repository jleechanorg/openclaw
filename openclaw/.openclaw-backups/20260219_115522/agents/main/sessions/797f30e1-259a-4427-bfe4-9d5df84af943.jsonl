This appears to be a character creation or game scenario (likely D&D/OpenClaw based on the context about \"character creation flow E2E test\").\n\nI should respond in character as a helpful assistant, but since this is a roleplay/tactical GM context, I need to be careful. The user is testing character creation, so I should be responsive to their actions.\n\nLet me check what context I have - they're in a test for character creation. The USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and MEMORY.md mentions \"First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting.\"\n\nSo it seems like they're testing a character creation flow. I should respond naturally to their action of looking around, but keep it simple since this is likely a test scenario.\n\nActually, wait - I need to be careful here. The instructions say \"You are a tactical GM\" in the group chat context. And there's a specific instruction in SOUL.md: \"Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.\"\n\nBut also MEMORY.md says \"When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\"\n\nThis seems like a test scenario. Let me just respond naturally to their action of looking around. If this is a character creation flow they're testing, I should respond as the environment/interface would.","thinkingSignature":"0ce1072690de3b4e50a460fa375b17dbb2a53395210f56962311733e70da2b7f"},{"type":"text","text":"You find yourself in a dimly lit study.
