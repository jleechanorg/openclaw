MEMORY.md mentions \"2025-07-09: First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\"\n3. The messages are numbered actions (Action 0, Action 1, Action 2) suggesting test automation\n\nThis seems to be a continuation of a test flow. Since this appears to be an automated test and there's no specific question or request beyond \"Action 2\", I should respond appropriately. \n\nLooking at the context, the previous responses were:\n- Action 0: \"Hey! What would you like to do?\"\n- Action 1: \"Got it, continuing the test. What's next?\"\n- Now Action 2\n\nThis seems to be a simple test flow. I should respond in a way that continues the test naturally. Since there's no specific task mentioned, I'll acknowledge the action and ask what's next (continuing the pattern).","thinkingSignature":"aafe47a23ff3980364092ab1728cf40d225eb0702589268e9f9cb52753b174d9"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Continuing the test flow - what's next?</final>"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":253,"cacheRead":7526,"cacheWrite":64,"totalTokens":7855,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771446886125}}
