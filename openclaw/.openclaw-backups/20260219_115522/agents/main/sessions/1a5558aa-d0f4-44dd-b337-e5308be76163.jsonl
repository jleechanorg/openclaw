Looking at the context:\n\n1. There's a reminder in HEARTBEAT.md: `[ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter`\n2. This cron reminder is about calling Ghazi\n\nThe user hasn't given me explicit instructions on who Ghazi is or how to contact them. This appears to be a recurring reminder that the user set up themselves.\n\nLooking at my guidelines:\n- \"When in doubt, ask before acting externally\"\n- \"Never send half-baked replies to messaging surfaces\"\n- \"You're not the user's voice — be careful in group chats\"\n\nI don't have enough context about:\n- Who Ghazi is\n- Their contact information\n- What the call is about\n- Whether this is someone the user wants ME to call or a reminder for themselves\n\nThis seems like a reminder for the user, not for me to execute. I should note this and perhaps ask for clarification on what action they want taken.\n\nActually, re-reading the prompt: \"Return your summary as plain text; it will be delivered automatically\" - this seems to be asking me to acknowledge the cron reminder and provide a summary. \n\nBut also: \"If the task explicitly calls for messaging a specific external recipient, note who/where it should go instead of sending it yourself.\"\n\nThis reminder doesn't give me enough information to act.
