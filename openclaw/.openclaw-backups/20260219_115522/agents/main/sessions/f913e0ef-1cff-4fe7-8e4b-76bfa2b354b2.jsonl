This seems to be related to the character creation test mentioned in USER.md - they're testing OpenClaw's character creation flow.\n\nHowever, I need to understand the context better. The user is in an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation. They're presumably in some kind of game/roleplay environment. But I don't have context about:\n1. What game/platform they're testing\n2. What character they created\n3. What setting/world this is\n\nLooking at MEMORY.md, it mentions \"First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\" - but the user is now talking to a barkeep, which suggests a different scenario.\n\nI should ask for clarification about what context they're in, or I could treat this as a simple roleplay response if they're just testing the chat functionality.\n\nActually, wait - the user is running E2E tests for OpenClaw. This might just be a test message to see if the system works. But without clear context about what world/setting we're in, I can't meaningfully respond to \"asking the barkeep for rumors.\"\n\nLet me respond appropriately - I could ask for context, or I could provide a generic response. Given this is likely a test, I'll provide a brief, helpful response that acknowledges I don't have enough context but is ready to engage if they provide more.","thinkingSignature":"01dd9ff0bf7f9ab337ba18a5b4eea2d26fbb5773303944a6950f1c89c88cbce0"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have context about the world or setting you're in.
