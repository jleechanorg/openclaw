It's currently 4:07 AM, so that's not the item being triggered.\n\nBut wait - the user message says \"[cron:f44e55e8-2af2-4e8a-91c3-4d64842eceb0 review-p-every-10m] 🔔 Reminder: Review P (every 10 min until ack)\"\n\nThis appears to be a cron job asking me to review something marked \"P\" every 10 minutes. However, I don't have any additional context about what \"P\" refers to. The HEARTBEAT.md doesn't mention anything about reviewing \"P\".\n\nWait - could \"P\" refer to something in the project context or an external system? Let me check if there's more context I'm missing. The cron name says \"review-p-every-10m\" - this suggests something specific needs to be reviewed.\n\nWithout more context about what \"P\" is, I should acknowledge this and ask for clarification. But wait - maybe this is related to the character creation E2E test session mentioned in MEMORY.md. Let me think...\n\nActually, looking at the context again - this appears to be a test session (test-openclaw_settings_e2e-1771500623). The cron is likely part of the test infrastructure. Since I don't have info about what \"P\" is, I should respond that I don't know what to review.\n\nBut per the instructions: \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\"\n\nGiven this is a cron for reviewing something specific (\"P\"), and I don't have context on what \"P\" is, I should ask. But this could also just be part of test infrastructure with no actual item to review.\n\nLet me try a different approach - maybe I should check if there's a P1 or priority item somewhere. But I have no file path or context about what \"P\" means.\n\nI think I need to respond that I don't have enough context to review \"P\" - I don't know what it refers to.","thinkingSignature":"ddf4d64c40ab328ccf4bed9dbb1d3627f6cce537f3d32d78a4d459323c7ab327"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have enough context to review \"P\" — I don't see any items marked as P in HEARTBEAT.md or the project files.
