Let me check HEARTBEAT.md for context on what needs to be reviewed.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThis mentions a cover letter review, but it's scheduled for 5:00 PM, not now (9:57 AM). The cron message says \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\" - this seems to be about reviewing \"P\" but I'm not sure what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait, this could be an internal cron for the E2E test session. Let me check the context - the user is running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation. The cron might be a test-specific reminder.\n\nHowever, I don't have enough information about what \"P\" refers to. It could be:\n1. A test parameter\n2. A process that needs review\n3. Something from a test specification\n\nI should check if there's any more context. But based on HEARTBEAT.md, there's a pending item about reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM - that's not due yet.\n\nSince this is a cron job and I don't have clear information about what \"P\" is, and the scheduled task (cover letter review) isn't due until 5 PM, I should acknowledge but note I need more context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instructions. For heartbeats:\n- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK\n- If something needs attention, do NOT include \"HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nThe cron message says \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\" - this suggests something needs attention/review. But I don't know what \"P\" is. \n\nI'll investigate the reminder's context carefully, seeking clarity on the specific review task.","thinkingSignature":"867220140840061d180437d300631f7fc540eb7b189bcd4b4c57bf63c43ef49a"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_25v5ktv2pss7_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"Review P cron reminder E2E test"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":435,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7295,"totalTokens":7742,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771523870368}}
