The user wants to create a character with:\n- Character: A hero\n- Setting: A small room\n- Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\n\nThis seems to be triggering the character creation flow. Let me check the loaded files to understand what's expected.\n\nFrom the project context, I see:\n1. This is a WorldArchitect.AI system (from the master_directive.md and other instruction files)\n2. There's a character_creation_instruction.md that guides character creation\n3. The character_prompt suggests they want to create a hero character in a small room setting\n\nHowever, looking at the input, it seems like they're just providing initial character context, not necessarily starting a full character creation flow. The key instruction in character_creation_instruction.md is:\n\n\"**CRITICAL**: Do NOT start the story. Do NOT advance any narrative. This is a 'pause menu' for character building.\"\n\nAnd: \"Your job: Help user build/level-up character with D&D 5e rules.\"\n\nLooking at the character_prompt \"Character: A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\" - this seems like they're providing some initial seed info for character creation.\n\nAccording to character_creation_instruction.md:\n- I should guide through phases: Concept → Mechanics → Personality → Completion\n- I need to provide choices in every response\n- I should start with Phase 1: Concept - offer three creation methods\n\nLet me provide a response that:\n1. Acknowledges the character seed info\n2. Offers the three creation methods as per the instruction\n3. Includes planning_block with choices\n\nThis is character creation mode, so I should follow that flow strictly.","thinkingSignature":"a37fb39151a3a36f1b088ead0e42e8af2f07dffe02d8ea338e91279c639a8aee"},{"type":"text","text":"I see you're starting an E2E test for OpenClaw with a hero character in a small room setting.
