According to the system prompt, I need to:\n1. Respond to the user_action field, NOT the story_history\n2. The priority_instruction says \"Focus exclusively on current user_action\"\n\nSo I should respond to their greeting \"Hello\" in a way that fits the game context.

In the context of this RPG, I should probably have NPCs or the narration respond appropriately. But wait - the user is just greeting the system/assistant, not their character speaking in-game.\n\nActually, re-reading this - the user_action is \"Hello\" which seems to be them testing the system. I should respond in a friendly way that acknowledges the greeting while staying in the game narrative context if appropriate.\n\nLet me create a response that:\n1. Acknowledges their greeting\n2. Stays in the narrative voice appropriate for the game\n3.
