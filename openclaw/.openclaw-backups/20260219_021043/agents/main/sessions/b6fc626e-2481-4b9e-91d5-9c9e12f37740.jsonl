The previous narrative ended with his ranger instincts prickling - something feels out of place\\n\\nI need to respond with JSON that:\\n- Has narrative (the story text)\\n- Has planning_block with choices\\n- Updates state appropriately\\n- Includes session_header with timestamp and location\\n- Shows resources\\n\\nSince the user said \\\"Start Adventure\\\" (very generic), I should interpret this as them beginning their actions.

Let me check what's expected:\\n- JSON with narrative, planning_block, state_updates, etc.\\n- The system prompt mentions I should generate deep think content in planning_block\\n\\nLooking at the game_state, there's already a planning_block with 4 choices. The user action is just \\\"Start Adventure\\\" which is very generic.\\n\\nI think the best interpretation is: Aric acts on his instincts and chooses to scan the perimeter (the most ranger-like action given the \\\"something feels out of place\\\" hook).\\n\\nFor the dice roll - if I'm having him do Perception to scan, I need to request it via tool_requests. But this is a low-risk action (scanning the perimeter), so maybe I don't need dice - it's more about narrative tension.\\n\\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully - the user said \\\"Start Adventure\\\" which seems to mean they want to begin. I should probably present the choices in the planning block and let them choose, OR I can interpret it as them choosing to act on the obvious hook (scanning perimeter).\\n\\nGiven the \\\"something feels out of place\\\" narrative hook, I'll have Aric choose to scan the perimeter - a natural ranger response to sensing danger.\\n\\nFor the JSON response format, I need to include:\\n\\n\\n- session_header: timestamp, location, status\\n- narrative: story text\\n- planning_block: thinking, choices\\n- resources: \\\"HD: 1/1, Spells: No Spells Yet (Level 2+), Potions: 0/0\\\"\\n- state_updates: any changes\\n\\nI'll update the timestamp to 20:10:00 to show time advancing (5 minutes passed during the scan).\\n\\nWait - I need to check if there are any tool requests needed. Scanning in a storm could be a Perception check. But since this is just beginning the watch and not a critical moment, I might not need dice.

In character, Aric should respond naturally to their situation.
