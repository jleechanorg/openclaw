This is very brief and unclear. Let me check what's happening - this seems to be part of an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation based on the USER.md context.\n\nThis might be a test signal or heartbeat. Let me check if there's anything in HEARTBEAT.md that needs attention, or if this is just a test message.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n- It says to keep it empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls\n- There are no active tasks listed\n\nThis appears to be an E2E test scenario. The user is \"Test User\" running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation. \"Action 0\" might be a test input or command.\n\nI should respond appropriately - but I need to understand what \"Action 0\" means in this context. Since this is likely a test, I should acknowledge and wait for more context, or respond in a way that's helpful for testing.\n\nGiven the context says this is an E2E test for character creation, and \"Action 0\" seems like it could be a test action, I should respond in a way that's natural but also appropriate for a test scenario.\n\nLet me respond naturally to engage with whatever testing is happening.","thinkingSignature":"b09f89c2113b4af8c60f3cdb9fcb27482818c6cd20c3d3e43b3b03a9c1a175d3"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Hey!
