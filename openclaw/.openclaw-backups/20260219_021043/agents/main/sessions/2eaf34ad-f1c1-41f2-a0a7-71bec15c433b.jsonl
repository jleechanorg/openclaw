This seems like a test message or heartbeat. Let me check the context - I'm in a test session for E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation.\n\nLooking at the context:\n- This is an E2E test for character creation\n- The runtime shows model=minimax-portal/MiniMax-M2.5\n- The user message is just \"Action 0\"\n\nThis appears to be a test input. Since there's no specific question or request, and this seems like a test/heartbeat type message, I should respond appropriately. \n\nLooking at MEMORY.md, there's a \"Silent Replies\" section that says:\n\"When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\"\n\nAnd under Heartbeats: \"If nothing needs attention, reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nThis appears to be either a test message or a heartbeat. Since \"Action 0\" doesn't indicate any specific task or question, and HEARTBEAT.md only has a reminder about reviewing a cover letter at 5PM (which isn't a current action), I should check if this is a heartbeat.\n\nGiven the context and the test nature of this session, \"Action 0\" seems like a simple test input. There's no actual question or request here. This could be part of E2E testing the character creation flow.\n\nLet me respond appropriately - since there's no clear question or task, and this appears to be a test, I should either:\n1. NO_REPLY - if nothing to say\n2. HEARTBEAT_OK - if it's a heartbeat\n\nGiven this is likely a test session and \"Action 0\" is a simple test input with no context asking anything, I'll respond with NO_REPLY as per the silent replies guidance.","thinkingSignature":"2edc8e92eba7a095e49f6e72149adcc89de9db520da6b3c2934b7860bf3e0f57"},{"type":"text","text":"NO_REPLY"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":370,"cacheRead":7798,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":8180,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771483237724}}
