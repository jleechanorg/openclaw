The user (Jeff) has a recurring reminder to call Ghazi. \n\nLooking at my context:\n- I'm in a test session (USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\")\n- This appears to be a test/reminder scenario\n- The runtime shows I'm in a test channel\n\nThis is a cron job reminder, not a regular message.

However, looking at MEMORY.md, there's no actual contact info for \"Ghazi\" - this seems to be a test cron job.\n\nGiven it's 2:28 AM (late night), and this appears to be a test session, I should acknowledge the reminder appropriately. But wait - looking at the instructions, this is an automated cron delivery, not a live human interaction. \n\nLet me think about what to do: This is a cron job reminder. According to the AGENTS.md guidelines about heartbeats, I should check if there's something that needs attention. In this case, it's a reminder to call someone. Since:\n1. It's 2:28 AM (late night/early morning)\n2. This is a test session (E2E tests)\n3.
