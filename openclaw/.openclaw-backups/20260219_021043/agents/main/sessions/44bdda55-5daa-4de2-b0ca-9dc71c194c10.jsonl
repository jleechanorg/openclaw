The game_state is empty, so this is starting fresh\n4.

Guide through the creation phases\n\nThe character_prompt gives me some info:\n- Character: A hero\n- Setting: A small room  \n- Description: Testing OpenClaw integration\n\nThis seems like they want me to create a character based on this prompt. Let me follow the character creation flow:\n\n1. First, I should display the campaign summary\n2. Then present the three options: AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class\n3.
