Since `KeepAlive=true` in the plist, macOS kept restarting the gateway every 10 seconds—it would start, see it's in remote mode, log \"Gateway start blocked\", exit, then relaunch.\n\n**The fix:** Remove that early return so the launchd job gets disabled regardless of mode. Switching back to local mode re-enables it.\n\n**Status:** Closed on Jan 28, 2026.
