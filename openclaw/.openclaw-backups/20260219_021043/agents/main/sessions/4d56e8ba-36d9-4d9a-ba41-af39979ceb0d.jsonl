This seems like a test message or heartbeat. Let me check the context - I'm in a test session for E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation.\n\nLooking at the rules:\n- This is a test session for E2E testing\n- There's a \"Silent Replies\" section that says when I have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\n\nBut wait - \"Action 0\" seems like it could be a test message. Let me think about what to do here. The user is running E2E tests. \"Action 0\" might be:\n1. A test message to see if the system responds\n2. A heartbeat check\n3. Just a simple test input\n\nLooking at the runtime info: channel=webchat, capabilities=none\n\nSince this appears to be a test and \"Action 0\" is a specific message, I should respond appropriately. This doesn't seem like a heartbeat poll (which would match the heartbeat prompt), and it seems like an actual message that needs a response.\n\nLet me just acknowledge this is the first action/test message.","thinkingSignature":"22d3ee6b4d79ca0d86a95ceefa3403066dba8849254ccb8a0c91d5d62fef77df"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Ready for action.
