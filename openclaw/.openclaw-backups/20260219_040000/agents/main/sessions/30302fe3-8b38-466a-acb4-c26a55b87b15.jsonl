Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md or any related context to understand what needs to be reviewed.\n\nLooking at the HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThis mentions reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM. But this cron is about \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\". \n\nI should check if there's more context about what \"P\" refers to. This seems to be a test session (USER.md mentions \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\").\n\nSince this is a cron job and there's no clear indication of what \"P\" is in the provided context, and HEARTBEAT.md only mentions a 5:00 PM reminder about a cover letter (which is already past - it's 9:57 PM), I should acknowledge this but note there's nothing specific to act on without more context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nActually, let me re-read - HEARTBEAT.md shows a reminder for 5:00 PM which has passed. The cron is asking me to review something called \"P\" every 10 minutes. Without knowing what \"P\" is, I can't really review it. This appears to be a test session for OpenClaw.\n\nI should respond that I don't know what \"P\" refers to and need more context.","thinkingSignature":"3530fdfd10bdacce40b5541cd7ddaf6a0b587f6ea12d25a49fac4757051ded65"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't see what \"P\" refers to in the available context.
