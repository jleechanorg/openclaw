This sounds like they're doing some kind of roleplay or interactive fiction - possibly related to the character creation testing mentioned in USER.md. Let me check what context I have.\n\nLooking at the context:\n- USER.md mentions \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"\n- MEMORY.md mentions \"2025-07-09: First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\"\n\nThis seems like they're testing some kind of game/D&D platform where they're creating characters. The barkeep interaction is likely part of a game scenario.\n\nI should respond in character as a barkeep would - offering rumors in a tavern setting. This is a classic RPG trope. I should be helpful and creative here.","thinkingSignature":"c263c6ca4c11ef3e21e0de0a6d72a14066c70679d840d5d34a9720f87d32195f"},{"type":"text","text":"The grizzled barkeep wipes a mug with a rag and leans in, lowering his voice.\n\n\"Rumors, eh?

Strange lights. Some say smugglers, others... less charitable guesses.\n\n- **Missing Caravan**: A merchant caravan vanished on the road to the eastern hills three weeks back. No bodies, no cargo—just gone.\n\n- **The Noble's Daughter**: Lord Ashford's girl ran off with a hedge knight. He's offering gold for her return—and pain for whoever helped her.\n\n- **Strange Peddler**: A hooded figure arrived last month, asking questions about ancient ruins.
