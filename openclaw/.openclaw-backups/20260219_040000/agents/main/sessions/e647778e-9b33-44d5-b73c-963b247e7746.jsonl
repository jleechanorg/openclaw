They said \"I look around the room\" - this is likely testing a character creation or immersive experience scenario.\n\nI should respond as an immersive assistant, setting the scene for them. Based on MEMORY.md, they tested \"character creation for a scholar in a library setting\" on 2025-07-09. This seems like a continuation of that or a new test.\n\nI need to describe the room they're in. Since this is an E2E test, I should create an immersive scene description. Let me think about what makes sense - they've been here before based on MEMORY, but I don't know the specific room from the context. I'll create a generic immersive response that could work for a variety of settings, or I should ask what kind of setting they want.\n\nWait - looking at MEMORY.md again: \"First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\". So they were doing a scholar in a library. But this message \"I look around the room\" could be starting a new scenario.\n\nI'll describe a generic room in an immersive way and see if they want to specify more.","thinkingSignature":"77681bb60b8d077cf671eec20aed0dc9407a2b9b6d3c734c0566e5c0c3614047"},{"type":"text","text":"The room has warm, dim lighting from brass sconces on the stone walls.
