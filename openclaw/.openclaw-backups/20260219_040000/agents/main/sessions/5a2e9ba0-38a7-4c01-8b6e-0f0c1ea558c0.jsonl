Let me analyze the input:\n\n- Game mode: character (character creation)\n- Character prompt: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n- No existing game state (empty)\n- No companions needed\n- Default world not used\n\nAccording to the character_creation_instruction.md, I need to:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Follow the flow: Concept → Mechanics → Personality → Completion\n\nThe user has provided a character prompt with concept, setting, and description. This seems like they want me to create a character based on this prompt.\n\nLet me start by presenting the three creation method options as required:\n- AI Generated\n- Standard D&D\n- Custom Class\n\nI should use the [AIGenerated] approach since they provided a detailed character prompt (scholar in a library seeking forgotten knowledge).\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully - the user has given me a character prompt that describes who they want to play. This is different from asking me to choose the creation method. \n\nLet me re-read: The user says \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge...\" - this is their character concept. They want to create this character.\n\nAccording to the flow, I should:\n1. Present the three options first (Phase 1: Concept)\n2. Wait for them to choose\n\nBut wait - they've already given me the concept! They've told me exactly what character they want. So maybe I should skip to presenting the character for review (the God Mode Template Review section says to present pre-made characters for review).\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the instructions:\n- If player_character_data is empty: guide through phases\n- The user hasn't provided character data yet - they've provided a character PROMPT\n\nI think the right approach is to treat this as the user providing a character concept, and I should generate a character based on it using the AIGenerated method, then present it for review.\n\n\nI'll craft a scholar character aligned with their vision, focusing on the library setting and quest for hidden knowledge. I'll prepare a detailed character sheet that captures the essence of their original prompt, ensuring it reflects the scholarly pursuit of ancient wisdom.","thinkingSignature":"362922459455127cc467cf2e8d55d8ed3bc5ec50afc7a3ab60f1edc95d7145e4"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a scholar character: A curious seeker of forgotten knowledge in a library setting.
