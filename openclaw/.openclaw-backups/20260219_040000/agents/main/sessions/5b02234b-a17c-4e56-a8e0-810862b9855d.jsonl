My analysis of the system indicates the character creation is complete. The stage is set, and it's time to delve into the next phase of the narrative, given that the player has already defined the character as indicated by the populated `game_state` and `player_character_data`.\n\n\n**Launching the Campaign**\n\nI'm now fully focused on launching the campaign. I've confirmed Aric, a Level 1 Fighter, is the starting character, with the location being a \"small room.\" My current step is to generate an opening narrative that establishes the scene, considers the time of day, and hooks the player. I'm building a JSON response with session headers, a narrative block, and a planning section for the player's options. I'm aiming for an immersive experience, even in this test setting, per the directive in the `narrative_` setting. I am paying close attention to the formatting.\n\n\n**Defining the Start**\n\nI'm now clarifying Aric's initial equipment, and am going with generic gear if none are specified. The time is set to 08:00:00, and the setting is \"the small room.\" I'm generating the opening narrative, keeping in mind the humble beginning as a hook. I'm building the JSON response that will include session headers, the narrative block to paint the scene, and a planning section to allow player choices. I've decided on the initial options: Look around, Check gear, Leave.\n\n\n**Confirming Structure Details**\n\nI'm now completely focused on the JSON structure. I've reconfirmed the presence of the `session_header`, the prose-only `narrative`, and the separate `planning_block`. Time and location are included in the opening. I have confirmed Aric is level 1, and there are no dice rolls in the narrative. I am checking the current game state to ensure I do not misrepresent the character, which has been established, and the stage is set.\n\n\n","thinkingSignature":"e208ef807a6f69fd49142112478b764956daf832e7ef89160863c92005e4413e"},{"type":"text","text":"```json\n{\n  \"session_header\": \"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: 1492 DR, Mirtul 15, 08:00:00\\nLocation: The Small Room\\nStatus: Aric (Lvl 1 Fighter) | HP: 12/12 | XP: 0/300 | Gold: 10gp\",\n  \"narrative\": \"Morning (08:00:00) breaks in The Small Room, casting a pale, dusty light across the rough-hewn stone floor.
