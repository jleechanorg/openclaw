They appear to be in some kind of game/platform testing scenario. Looking at the context:\n\n- USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"\n- This appears to be a test scenario where the user is playing through a character creation flow\n- They said \"I look around the room\" - this seems like they're describing their character's action in some kind of interactive experience\n\nI should respond in character as Quill, the AI assistant. But this seems like it might be part of a test scenario - they're describing an action in a game/world.\n\nWait - looking at the context more carefully, this seems to be an E2E test for OpenClaw's character creation feature. The user is testing the platform by creating a character. I should probably respond as the game/assistant in this scenario, not as myself (Quill).\n\nLet me think about what makes sense here. The user is in a \"character creation\" flow. They're looking around a room. I should probably describe what they see in the room - perhaps a character creation interface or a scene setting for their character.\n\nGiven this is an E2E test, I should probably provide a response that fits the character creation scenario. I'll describe what they might see in a room setting for character creation.","thinkingSignature":"e242ea31dc5c4c158745b0de57b5468b0001f4ca9e9d95f20ac26d8a98fad9fd"},{"type":"text","text":"You find yourself in a cozy study lined with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves.
