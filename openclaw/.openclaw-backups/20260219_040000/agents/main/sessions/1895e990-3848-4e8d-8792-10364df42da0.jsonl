The user needs to either:\n- Confirm and start the game (\"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\")\n- Edit the character\n\nSince I don't have the actual prior conversation context in this specific message (this appears to be a fresh API call), I need to determine what to do. \n\nLooking at the user input again - it has `user_action: \"\"` empty. This seems like it could be the start of a fresh character creation flow, OR it could be continuing from where we left off.\n\n\nI'll continue the character creation flow, generating a scholarly wizard character with a focus on knowledge-seeking. I'll propose Caelum Ashford, a Human Wizard with the Lore Master archetype, emphasizing their quest for hidden knowledge in the library setting. The character will reflect the \"curious scholar\" concept, potentially with traits like inquisitive nature, love of ancient texts, and a mysterious background connected to forgotten lore.","thinkingSignature":"5b9a88808ee2170ac3e1b6e788a8584cd3808be9f2748fd08f1fc1389266f168"},{"type":"text","text":"Looking at the context, this appears to be a continuation of the E2E test from Session 3 where you selected \"AI Generated\" and a character was generated.
