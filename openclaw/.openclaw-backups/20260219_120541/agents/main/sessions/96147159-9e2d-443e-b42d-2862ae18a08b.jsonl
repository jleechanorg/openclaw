Without more context, I don't know what \"P\" refers to. It could be a placeholder for something specific to the E2E test.\n\nWait - looking at the MEMORY context, it mentions:\n- Test user: test-openclaw_settings_e2e-1771500623\n- Game mode: character (character creation in progress)\n- Character prompt: \"A hero\" in \"A small room\" for E2E testing\n- Status: Redirected user from story action back to character creation - awaiting selection\n\nSo there's an ongoing character creation E2E test.
