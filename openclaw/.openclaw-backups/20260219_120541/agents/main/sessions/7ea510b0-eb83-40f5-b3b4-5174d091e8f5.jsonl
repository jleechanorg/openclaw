The user has sent a character creation initialization payload. Looking at the context:\n\n1. This is a character creation flow (game_mode: \"character\")\n2. The user has provided a character concept: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n3. Setting: \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n4. This is an E2E test session for OpenClaw\n\nAccording to the character creation instructions in AGENTS.md and the game_state_instruction.md, I need to:\n\n1. **NOT start the story** - this is character creation mode, not story mode\n2. **Present creation method options** - three options: AI Generated, Standard DND, Custom Class\n3. **Include a planning_block with choices** - required in every response\n4. **Use the [CHARACTER CREATION - <stage>] tag** in narrative\n\nThe character_prompt contains the concept, but I need to guide the user through the creation process.\n\nLet me structure my response:\n- Narrative should introduce the character creation process\n- Planning block should offer the three creation method choices\n- State updates should track the creation stage\n\nWait - the character_prompt has \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" - this seems like they want me to use this concept. Let me check the character creation flow again.\n\nLooking at AGENTS.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - \"What kind of character?\"\n- Phase 2: Mechanics - Build the character\n- Phase 3: Personality (Optional)\n- Phase 4: Completion\n\nThe user HAS provided a concept in character_prompt. So I should:\n1. Acknowledge the concept they provided\n2. Ask which creation method they want to use\n\nActually, wait - the character_prompt field says \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" - this IS the character concept. Let me re-read the instructions...\n\nIn character_creation_instruction.md, there's:\n\n\n- \"When player_character_data is empty or incomplete, guide through these phases\"\n\nBut there's also guidance for when a character concept is provided. Looking at the prompt, the user gave:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\n\nThis appears to be a concept description, not a full character. So I should present the three creation methods and let them choose. The concept gives me enough to work with - I'll acknowledge what they've described and then present the options for how to build the character.\n\nI need to be careful about following the rules: every response requires a planning_block with choices, and I must use the [CHARACTER CREATION - <stage>] tag. Since no character data exists yet, I'll guide them through the standard creation flow starting with Phase 1.","thinkingSignature":"0844254b8ac2ce6e8302ac74ec3c40fc877e9a2da82782f32494ea4bb492d7e3"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYour character concept is noted: **A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge**, set in **a quiet library filled with ancient tomes**.\n\nBefore we build your character, I need to know which creation method you'd prefer:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"session_header\": \"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nMode: Character Creation\\nStatus: Creating new character\",\n  \"narrative\": \"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\\n\\nYou've described a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge, adventuring in a library of ancient tomes.
