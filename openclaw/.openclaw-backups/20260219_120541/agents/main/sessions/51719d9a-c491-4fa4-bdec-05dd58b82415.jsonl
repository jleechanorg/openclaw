I'll create a fully fleshed-out character with race, class, abilities, equipment, and background—all tailored to your vision.\n\n**Option 2: [StandardDND]**\nGo through the traditional step-by-step D&D character creation process. You'll choose your race, class, assign ability scores, pick skills and equipment, and develop your background.\n\n**Option 3: [CustomClass]**\nDesign a custom class or modify an existing one. This is ideal if you want something unique that doesn't fit standard D&D classes.\n\nWhich option would you like to choose?
