Looking at the game_state, the last_story_mode_sequence_id is 4, but the story has progressed to sequence 6.\n\nWait - I need to follow the priority_instruction which says to respond to user_action, NOT story_history. But \"Start Adventure\" doesn't match any of the planning_block choices. \n\nLet me think about this differently:\n- The planning_block choices are: enter_chamber, request_details, light_first, call_for_help\n- The user_action is \"Start Adventure\"\n\n\n- I'm uncertain how to map this to the existing choices\n\nThe user might be signaling readiness to begin, but I can't match their input precisely to the available options. This looks like a potential testing scenario where the action doesn't align cleanly with the expected choices. Given the constraints, I need to either seek clarification or make a reasonable interpretation about how to proceed with the adventure.\n\nThe planning block's core purpose is providing meaningful choices to the player. Since their selected option doesn't directly correspond, I'll need to either ask for clarification or select the most logical default approach based on their \"Start Adventure\" message.\n\nThe most sensible interpretation seems to be guiding them toward one of the existing planning block choices that aligns with beginning an adventure, likely the first option.\n\nThe story history reveals their previous choice was \"Investigate Immediately\" - which maps closest to entering the chamber. I'll align with that intent, selecting the most appropriate corresponding choice from the available options.\n\nMy response will acknowledge their \"Start Adventure\" action and transition to the narrative beat matching their investigative approach, potentially selecting \"Enter the Chamber\" as the primary choice.\n\nHowever, I'm noticing a critical rule: I cannot independently execute actions or generate dice rolls without explicit tool requests. This means I must carefully frame my response to match their intent while respecting procedural constraints.\n\nThe user's action suggests they're ready to begin their investigative journey into the mysterious chamber, so I'll craft a response that honors that preparatory state without prematurely resolving the encounter.\n\nI'll select the most appropriate planning choice - \"Enter the Chamber\" - and construct a narrative progression that logically follows their \"Start Adventure\" intent, ensuring I maintain the interactive storytelling framework while adhering to the specified protocols.\n\nThe sequence reveals a potential discrepancy between story progression and current user input, suggesting I should carefully reconcile the narrative state with the explicit user action. My response must elegantly bridge this gap, acknowledging their current engagement while respecting the established story flow.\n\nI'll craft a response that seamlessly integrates their desire to start the adventure with the most contextually appropriate choice from the existing planning options.","thinkingSignature":"f24d3e8a9c7870d3ee25a57c64edb15538c445c9fb89c0770384cf507505137a"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Morning (08:28:00) in Sector VII — you take a steadying breath, looking between the terrified archivist and the yawning darkness beyond the open door.\n\n\"Very well,\" you say, stepping toward the threshold. \"Stay close, Master Corvinus.\"\n\nThe chamber beyond is cylindrical, its walls lined with dormant arcane symbols.
