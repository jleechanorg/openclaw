The air is thick with the scent of aged vellum, candle wax, and something older—something that clings to the back of the throat like a half-remembered word.\\n\\nAric (Lvl 1) sits at a scarred reading table near the center of the great hall, an open tome before him written in a script that shifts subtly when viewed from different angles. He has been here since before dawn, drawn by the same restless hunger that has driven him from one archive to the next across the Sword Coast: the certainty that something vital has been deliberately erased from the historical record.\\n\\nThe Athenaeum is no ordinary library. Tucked into a forgotten quarter of the city, it appears on no official map. Aric found it only by following a cryptic reference in a water-damaged journal purchased from a half-blind bookseller in Baldur's Gate—a journal that mentioned \\\"the place where forbidden pages go to sleep.\\\"\\n\\nThe shelves stretch upward into shadow, three stories tall, connected by narrow iron walkways that groan faintly in the stillness. At this early hour, the library appears empty, though the candles on the reading tables are freshly lit—someone tends this place.\\n\\nA sound breaks the silence: the deliberate creak of a floorboard from somewhere deeper in the stacks. Then a voice, low and papery, drifts between the shelves like smoke.\\n\\n\\\"You've been reading that same page for forty minutes, young man.\\\" A figure emerges from the shadows—an elderly woman with sharp silver eyes and ink-stained fingers, leaning on a cane carved from what appears to be a single enormous bone. Orla Duskmantle (Lvl 4), the Athenaeum's keeper, studies Aric with an expression caught between amusement and suspicion. \\\"Most visitors who find this place are looking for something specific. And most of them shouldn't be.\\\"\\n\\nShe sets a clay cup of black tea on the table beside him, uninvited. The steam curls in shapes that almost resemble letters.\\n\\n\\\"So tell me, scholar-who-carries-a-sword,\\\" she says, settling into the chair across from him with the careful deliberation of someone whose bones have earned the right to complain. \\\"What is it you're hunting in my pages?\\\"\",\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"Orla is the gatekeeper to whatever secrets this library holds.
