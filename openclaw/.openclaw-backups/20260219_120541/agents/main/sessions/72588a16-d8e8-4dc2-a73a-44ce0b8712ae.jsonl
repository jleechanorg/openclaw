I'll have Aric make a deliberate choice to move forward, perhaps by questioning Corvinus or preparing to enter the chamber. The goal is to maintain narrative momentum while respecting the player's previous investigation intent.\n\nThe key is to create a smooth transition that acknowledges the previous investigation while pushing the story forward.
