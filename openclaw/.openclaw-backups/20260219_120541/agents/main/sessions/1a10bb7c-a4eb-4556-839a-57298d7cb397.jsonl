This seems like a test message or possibly a heartbeat poll based on the context. Let me check what I should do.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md:\n\"# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\n# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\"\n\nThe file only has comments, so there's nothing that needs attention. This looks like it could be a heartbeat poll.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n\"If you receive a heartbeat poll (a user message matching the heartbeat prompt above), and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly:\nHEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nBut wait - this message is \"Action 0\", not the heartbeat prompt. The heartbeat prompt from the system says:\n\"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n\nThis seems like it might be a test message. The user is running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation according to USER.md.\n\nActually, \"Action 0\" might just be a simple test message. Given this is an E2E test scenario and the message is just \"Action 0\", I should probably respond appropriately. But wait - there's a \"Silent Replies\" section in MEMORY.md that says:\n\n\"When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\"\n\nBut this is for when I genuinely have nothing to say. This seems like a test message, so I should respond to it.\n\nGiven the context (E2E test), \"Action 0\" might be expecting some specific response or action. Let me just acknowledge it briefly since it's unclear what else to do.\n\nActually, re-reading the situation - this is clearly a test scenario. The user is testing character creation flow. \"Action 0\" might be expecting a response. I'll give a simple acknowledgment.","thinkingSignature":"ab075cdb598221f6133650ef5b323f2db21f08eda58f1e0d4d2c200b265dac09"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Ready for action.
