Let me check HEARTBEAT.md to see what's expected.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nSo there's a reminder about reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM. But the cron message is about \"review-p-every-10m\" which seems to be a periodic task.\n\nHowever, the current time is 10:17 AM, not 5:00 PM. The cron message is asking me to review \"P\" every 10 minutes.\n\nI don't have context about what \"P\" refers to. It could be:\n- A document\n- A person\n- A task\n\nSince this is a cron reminder and there's no specific \"P\" context in the files I've been given, I should ask for clarification about what \"P\" refers to, or acknowledge that I need more information.\n\nActually, wait - let me re-read the instructions. The heartbeat prompt says to \"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists\" and \"Follow it strictly.\"\n\nHEARTBEAT.md has:\n- A comment saying to keep it empty to skip heartbeat API calls\n- A reminder about 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n\nBut the cron message is about \"review-p-every-10m\". This doesn't match what's in HEARTBEAT.md.\n\nSince there's no clear match between the cron message and HEARTBEAT.md content, and I don't know what \"P\" is, I should ask for clarification.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully - it says \"If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\" \n\nThe cron task \"review-p-every-10m\" suggests there IS something that needs attention - I need to review \"P\". But I don't know what \"P\" is without more context.\n\n\nI need to ask what \"P\" refers to since there's insufficient context to proceed with the review.","thinkingSignature":"9a57bc0d0315303c705a640980a081ed3a60465fee8d287c9afe7c68275ebc79"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have enough context about what \"P\" refers to.
