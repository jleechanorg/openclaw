Looking at the context, the previous messages were:\n- \"Do something 0\"\n- \"Do something 1\" \n- I responded \"What would you like me to do?\"\n- Now \"Do something 2\"\n\nThis appears to be an E2E test scenario. The USER.md mentions \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and \"Testing the OpenClaw platform integration - character creation flow E2E test.\"\n\nSince this is a test scenario and the user hasn't given me specific instructions on what \"something 2\" should be, I should probably just acknowledge and ask what they'd like me to do, or provide a simple response. This seems like a simple test to ensure I'm responding.\n\nLet me keep it simple and just respond naturally.","thinkingSignature":"aa117f0ec9113da484f6312a3ae1808f6544bb027cc4f268e85f146a44a24ac5"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Hey!
