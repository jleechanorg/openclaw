I need to follow the character creation flow from AGENTS.md and the character_creation_instruction.md file.\n\nLooking at the input:\n- `game_mode: \"character\"` - We're in character creation mode\n- `character_prompt` has the character concept\n- `generate_companions: false` - No companions needed\n- `world_data` is empty\n\nAccording to the character creation instructions, I should:\n1. Present the character for review (since there's a character prompt provided)\n2. Use the tag `[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]`\n3. Provide the two choices: Edit Character and Finish Character Creation and Start Game\n\nThe character concept is \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" set in \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\". This is a pre-populated character concept, not a full character sheet yet.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the input - there's no `player_character_data` in `game_state`. It's empty. So this is not a pre-made character sheet, it's a character concept/prompt that needs to be developed.\n\nGiven the instructions:\n- Phase 1: Concept - already provided (curious scholar)\n- Need to proceed to Phase 2: Mechanics\n\nActually, let me re-read the character_prompt: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n\nThis gives me the character concept. According to the flow, I should:\n1. Acknowledge the character concept\n2. Ask what creation method they want to use (AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class)\n\n\n3. Since this is a test session and the concept is clear, I can present this as a starting point and offer the standard character creation options.\n\nI'll present the concept and offer choices for how to proceed with building the character.","thinkingSignature":"76aac2a9ccf5dd7f26a4657910b8b1a1c962758938f791ba2c69c6f2bdbaa0fe"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a **curious scholar** seeking forgotten knowledge, set in a **quiet library filled with ancient tomes**.
