Let me think about what's happening here:\n\n1. The context shows I'm running as \"Quill\" in an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation\n2. The USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and \"Testing the OpenClaw platform integration - character creation flow E2E test\"\n3. This appears to be a test scenario where the user is testing some kind of game/world interaction\n\nHowever, I don't have clear context about what world/scenario we're in. The MEMORY.md mentions \"2025-07-09: First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\" but that was from a previous session.\n\nI should ask for clarification about the setting/scenario since this seems like a test and I don't have context about what world we're in. Or maybe this is a new test scenario and I should just respond as a barkeep would?\n\nActually, wait - looking at the runtime info: channel=webchat, this seems to be a test session. The user is testing character creation or some kind of interactive scenario. I should probably just play along and respond as a barkeep would, making up some appropriate rumors for a generic fantasy setting (since that's the most common assumption).\n\nLet me respond as a helpful barkeep with some generic but interesting rumors.","thinkingSignature":"b6c671876c1123f21b4a2c9023e3968baf003235e5a441fc7e2a76758edfeb14"},{"type":"text","text":"The grizzled barkeep wipes a mug with a rag and leans in, lowering his voice.\n\n\"Ah, rumors?
