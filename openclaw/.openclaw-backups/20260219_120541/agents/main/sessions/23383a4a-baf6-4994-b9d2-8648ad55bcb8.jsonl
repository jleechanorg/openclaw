Based on the context:\n\n1. This is a browser lifecycle test for OpenClaw character creation\n2. Game mode: character (character creation mode)\n3. Character concept: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n4. Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n\nAccording to my AGENTS.md and character_creation_instruction.md, I need to:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character creation mode\n2. Present the character creation options (AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class)\n3. Always provide choices with \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last option\n\nThe character_prompt contains the concept: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" and setting context. This looks like a template-provided character concept that I should work with.\n\nSince no player_character_data is provided yet, this is a fresh character creation. I should follow the Phase 1: Concept flow from character_creation_instruction.md.\n\nWait - looking at the context more carefully, I see in MEMORY.md:\n- \"Character concept: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n- \"Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n- \"Status: Presented creation method options (AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class)\"\n\nSo it seems like I've already presented the options. But this is a fresh session (the input shows empty game_state). Let me check what's actually being requested here.\n\nThe input shows:\n- game_mode: \"character\" \n- character_prompt with the concept\n- Empty game_state\n\nThis appears to be the start of a new character creation. I should present the three creation method options as per the character creation flow.\n\nActually, looking at character_creation_instruction.md - when there's a character_prompt with concept, I could potentially use that to generate an AI-created character. But I should first ask which method they want.\n\nLet me present the options:\n1. AI Generated - create based on the scholar concept\n\n\n2. Standard D&D - traditional step-by-step\n3. Custom Class - design custom\n\nI need to include choices and remember to always have \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last option.","thinkingSignature":"19da237f0e3da5d49d16d93c1f41cfc688e7bef5cf7729833f32017475baa4c9"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nI see you're looking to create a character for an E2E test campaign — a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge, set in a quiet library filled with ancient tomes.\n\nBefore we build your character, how would you like to proceed?\n\n**Option 1: AI Generated**\nLet me create a complete character based on your scholar concept — I'll generate the race, class, abilities, and equipment automatically.\n\n**Option 2: Standard D&D**\nTraditional step-by-step creation — choose your race, class, assign ability scores, pick background and equipment yourself.\n\n**Option 3: Custom Class**\nDesign a completely custom class with unique features and abilities.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"User is starting character creation for an E2E test.
