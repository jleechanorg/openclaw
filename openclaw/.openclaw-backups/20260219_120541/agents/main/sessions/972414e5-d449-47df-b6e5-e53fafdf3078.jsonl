Since this is an E2E test, I need to understand what \"Action 2\" means in the context of character creation. But I don't have specific context about what Action 2 should do.\n\nLet me respond acknowledging Action 2 and asking what the next step should be, or I could try to infer this is part of a test sequence and respond in a way that continues the flow.\n\nGiven this is a test, I should probably just acknowledge and continue the conversation like before.","thinkingSignature":"110bf3c688d31978f2a90af03fcc39f0483651382d6f139319fa96c6a553e177"},{"type":"text","text":"Action 2 received.
