This is character creation mode\n2. Since game_state is empty and there's a character_prompt, I should use the AI Generated approach (option 1)\n3. Present the character for review with choices\n\nLet me check the character_prompt:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\n\nSince there's no pre-populated player_character_data, and there's a character prompt provided, I should generate a character based on this prompt using the AI Generated method.\n\nAccording to AGENTS.md:\n- For AI Generated: Ask for theme/concept, generate character\n\nBut wait - the character_prompt already contains the concept. So I should generate the character directly.\n\nLet me create a character based on:\n- A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n\nI need to follow the response format from character_creation_instruction.md:\n- Use tag: `[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]` in narrative\n- Show character name, race, class, abilities, equipment\n- Provide exactly two choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nLet me generate a scholar character. A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge would likely be:\n\n\n- Race: Human or Elf (for longevity to seek knowledge)\n- Class: Wizard (seeking forgotten knowledge) or maybe Rogue (for hidden knowledge) or Bard (for lore)\n- Background: Sage (perfect for a scholar)\n\nI'll craft a Human Wizard with Sage background to match the scholarly pursuit of forgotten knowledge. This aligns perfectly with the character's core motivation of exploring ancient mysteries in a library setting.","thinkingSignature":"d460d750ce2a2c0d94566d48293637b8f0395d59bc704984072b334656ace269"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]\n\nBased on your concept of a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library, I've created:\n\n**Cedric Thornwood** — *Human Wizard (Sage)*\n\n**Ability Scores:**\n- STR 8 (-1) | DEX 12 (+1) | CON 10 (0)\n- INT 16 (+3) | WIS 14 (+2) | CHA 10 (0)\n\n**Background:** Sage — Expert in ancient histories and forgotten lore.
