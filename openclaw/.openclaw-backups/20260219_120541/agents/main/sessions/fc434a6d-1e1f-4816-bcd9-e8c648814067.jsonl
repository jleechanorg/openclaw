This seems to be part of a roleplay or game scenario, likely related to the OpenClaw platform mentioned in the context (E2E tests for character creation).\n\nLooking at the context:\n- USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"\n- MEMORY.md mentions \"First session - browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\"\n\nThis appears to be a test scenario for a game/RPG platform. The user is playing as some kind of character (possibly a scholar based on the memory) inspecting ruins.\n\nI should respond in character and help with this scenario.
