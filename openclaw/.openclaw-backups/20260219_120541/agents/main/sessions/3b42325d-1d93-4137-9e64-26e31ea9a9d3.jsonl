Let me check what HEARTBEAT.md says and see if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nLooking at my context files:\n- HEARTBEAT.md has a reminder for 5:00 PM to review Cindil's cover letter\n- This appears to be a separate cron job\n\nThe cron message says \"review-p-every-10m\" which seems like a task I need to do. Let me think about what \"P\" could be:\n- Could be a PR (Pull Request)?\n- Could be a person (P name)?\n- Could be a document?\n\nSince this is a cron job with a specific identifier, I should check if there's any context in my files about what \"P\" refers to. Let me check the current session context or recent memory.\n\nActually, I don't have specific context about what \"P\" refers to. The cron job just says to review it every 10 minutes. I should check if there's any relevant information in my workspace or if I need to ask the user what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait - I should check HEARTBEAT.md more carefully and see if there's context. Let me also check memory files.\n\nActually, looking at the runtime info, this is a test session for \"OpenClaw character creation E2E test\". This might be part of a test scenario. Without more context about what \"P\" is, I should acknowledge and ask for clarification, or check if there's something obvious I'm missing.\n\nLet me check if there's any P-related content in the workspace quickly.","thinkingSignature":"8afb18139062b591158b4a5e139f3e2fb0b19137922fdf3e034ddf1ce2a00129"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_csu7lai9qfuv_1","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"ls -la"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":366,"cacheRead":1626,"cacheWrite":6239,"totalTokens":8243,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771498071706}}
