Let me check the HEARTBEAT.md file that was mentioned in the context to see if there are any tasks or details about calling Ghazi.\n\nLooking at the HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThis is about a 5:00 PM reminder for reviewing Cindil's cover letter. The current time is 5:58 AM, so this is a different reminder.\n\nThe user message mentions a reminder to call Ghazi (recurring until ACK). This appears to be an automated reminder that was scheduled. \n\nHowever, I don't have specific information about who Ghazi is or the context of why I need to call them. The reminder seems to be from an external cron system.\n\nSince this is a reminder/cron task and not a direct request for me to take action, and there's no specific context about who Ghazi is or what the call is about, I should acknowledge this is a reminder but note that I don't have enough context to act on it.\n\nWait - I need to follow the instructions. The reminder says \"Call Ghazi (recurring until ACK)\". This seems like an external action that requires me to call someone. But I don't have calling capabilities built-in (there's a voice-call skill but that requires explicit setup).\n\nLet me check if there's any info in the workspace files about Ghazi... Looking at the context provided, there's nothing about Ghazi.\n\nI should return a summary as plain text as instructed. Since this is a cron reminder and I don't have context about who Ghazi is or the purpose of the call, I should note that this reminder was received but requires more context.","thinkingSignature":"41c7d26e35cde46c6a3524510edef2b6f234778fab67786669cb43aa695841c6"},{"type":"text","text":"Summary: Received recurring reminder to call Ghazi.
