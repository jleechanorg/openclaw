This reminder seems to be about reviewing something \"P\" - possibly a different task or a test cron.\n\nGiven this is an E2E test session and the reminder mentions \"review-p-every-10m\", this seems like a test/placeholder cron. There's nothing specific to act on at 6:17 AM regarding the 5:00 PM reminder.\n\nI should respond that there's nothing requiring attention at this time.","thinkingSignature":"fd57faff57c806831a8621e23dd5d0a6b093750a79c96d08ab6aaf173a60be3b"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":180,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7295,"totalTokens":7487,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771510670380}}
