Let me check what's needed.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThere's a reminder to review Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM. The current time is 7:17 PM, so this reminder is past its scheduled time. This is likely what \"P\" refers to - the cover letter review task.\n\nHowever, I don't have the actual cover letter content to review. I should check if there's a file related to Cindil's cover letter in the workspace, or I need to ask the user for it.\n\nWait - this is a cron job, not a heartbeat. The instruction says \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\". This seems to be a persistent reminder about something called \"P\" that needs review.\n\nLet me check the workspace for any cover letter or document that might need review.","thinkingSignature":"c69b10fbd0ee7ea7b6268ebefa689fbd639cb9526f56eeb3c2aafcd202855a6f"},{"type":"text","text":"I see a reminder to review Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM.
