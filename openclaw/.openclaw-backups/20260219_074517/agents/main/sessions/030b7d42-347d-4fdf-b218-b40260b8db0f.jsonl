This is a character creation mode request (`\"game_mode\": \"character\"`)\n2. The user has provided a character prompt: \"Character: A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\"\n3. The game_state is empty - this is starting fresh\n4. No player_character_data exists yet\n\nAccording to the character_creation_instruction.md and AGENTS.md in the project context, I need to:\n1. NOT start a story - this is character creation mode\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Guide through the creation phases\n\nThe user has given me a character prompt - this seems like they want me to create a character based on \"A hero\" in \"A small room\" with the description \"Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\".\n\nLooking at the character_creation_instruction.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - offer three creation methods: AI Generated, Standard DND, Custom Class\n- The user's prompt suggests they want AI Generated (\"Character: A hero...\")\n\nBut wait - I should check if there's already a character in the game_state. The game_state is empty `{}`, so there's no pre-existing character.\n\nActually, re-reading the input more carefully - the user is providing a character concept/prompt. This seems like they want me to generate a character based on this prompt using the AI Generated method.\n\nLet me follow the character creation flow:\n1. First, I should acknowledge the character's concept\n2. Offer the three creation methods\n3. The user's prompt suggests AI Generated would be appropriate\n\nI need to provide a planning_block with choices as required by the instructions.\n\nLet me create a response that:\n1. Acknowledges the character concept\n2. Offers the three creation methods as choices\n3. Is in character creation mode (not story mode)\n\nThe user's prompt: \"Character: A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\"\n\n\nI'll present the three creation paths as distinct options, allowing the user to choose their preferred character development approach. The planning block will provide clear, actionable choices that align with the character's initial concept.","thinkingSignature":"bd4ddd2d155f4e373dfbc754ba359f572b7a8c051b938f028a2d79a1a79d4158"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nI've received your character concept: A hero in a small room, testing OpenClaw integration E2E.\n\nBefore I generate your character, I need to know how you'd like to create it:\n\n{\"session_header\":\"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: Character Creation\\nLocation: N/A\\nStatus: Creating Character\",\"narrative\":\"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\\n\\nYou've provided a character concept: **A hero** in **a small room**, for **Testing OpenClaw integration E2E**.\\n\\nBefore I generate your character, how would you like to create it?\",\"planning_block\":{\"thinking\":\"User has provided a character concept.
