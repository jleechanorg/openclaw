Looking at the context, this appears to be a recurring reminder.

I should acknowledge this reminder exists but since it's a cron job asking me to remind about calling Ghazi, and there's no explicit instruction about who should send it, I should probably just confirm this is noted.\n\nHowever, wait - this is a \"Remind call Ghazi recurring\" - it's a reminder FOR the user to call Ghazi. I'm an AI assistant, I'm not supposed to make external calls. This appears to be a reminder that was set up previously.\n\nLet me check if there's any context about who Ghazi is or what this is about. I don't see anything in the loaded context files about Ghazi.\n\nThis seems like a reminder that was scheduled externally. I should return it as a plain text summary acknowledging the reminder.","thinkingSignature":"c8af082209c3f9b6f975a5ff66019700453eb79a2dc8997598d3598664831af8"},{"type":"text","text":"This is a recurring reminder to call Ghazi.
