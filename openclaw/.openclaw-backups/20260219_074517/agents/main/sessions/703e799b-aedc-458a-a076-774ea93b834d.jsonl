The game_state shows:\n   - Character already exists: \"Aric\" - Level 1 Fighter\n   - Character creation is marked as complete: `character_creation_completed: true`\n   - `character_creation_stage: \"complete\"`\n   - `character_creation_in_progress: false`\n\n3. The user_action is \"Start Adventure\"\n\n4. The story_history shows:\n   - User provided a character concept: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n   - Setting: \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n   - But then the game_state has a completely different character: Aric, a Fighter\n\n5. There's a mismatch - the user wanted a scholar but got a Fighter\n\nAccording to AGENTS.md, since character_creation_completed is true and character_creation_in_progress is false, I should NOT be in character creation mode. The user wants to start the adventure.\n\nBut wait - there's a conflict. The user specified they wanted a \"curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" but the character in game_state is \"Aric\" a Fighter. This seems like a bug in the test setup.\n\nHowever, the user_action is \"Start Adventure\". According to the priority_instruction, I should respond to user_action, not the story_history.\n\nSo the user wants to start the adventure. Since character creation is marked complete, I should transition to story mode and begin the adventure in the setting described (a quiet library filled with ancient tomes).\n\nLet me check what mode I should be in. The game_mode in the input is \"character\" but character_creation_completed is true. This seems like a transition point.\n\nAccording to AGENTS.md - when character creation is complete, I should offer \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" choice. But the user already clicked \"Start Adventure\" which is essentially that.\n\n\nNow I need to begin the story. The character Aric is a Level 1 Fighter, the setting is a quiet library, and the user's original concept was a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. I should start the adventure in story mode, incorporating the scholar concept even though the character's class is Fighter.","thinkingSignature":"01d695ce248538c20abd610330b1a55ea02083ec2f215c37fa907544a1b36928"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_t5c1ncx1nkk9_1","name":"exec","arguments":{"command":"date +\"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z\""}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":495,"cacheRead":44994,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":45501,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771498621874}}
