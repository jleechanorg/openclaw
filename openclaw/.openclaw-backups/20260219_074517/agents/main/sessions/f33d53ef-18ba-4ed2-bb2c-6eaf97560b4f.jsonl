You're right — that's sloppy.\\n\\nThe 9:00 AM check-in was a **cron job** (scheduled automated message) that ran with stale/good-enough defaults — it checks for unread emails and calendar events, but when it can't fetch data (like when Gmail search fails), it falls back to \\\"none\\\" rather than saying \\\"couldn't check.\\\"\\n\\nThe other message (about psych, contractors, maid) was me actually *trying* to help with real context — but I clearly didn't connect the two. The cron job should have said \\\"couldn't check\\\" instead of \\\"none,\\\" and I should have been consistent.\\n\\nThat's a real bug in how the daily check-in handles failures.
