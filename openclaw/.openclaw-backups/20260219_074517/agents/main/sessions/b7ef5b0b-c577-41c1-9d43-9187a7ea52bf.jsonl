Looking at my context, I see HEARTBEAT.md has a reminder:\n\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nBut the cron message mentions \"P\" - this seems to be about something called \"P\" that needs review every 10 minutes. This is likely unrelated to HEARTBEAT.md since HEARTBEAT.md is workspace context and this is a cron reminder.\n\nSince I don't have any context about what \"P\" refers to or why it needs review, and the cron is asking me to acknowledge (ack), I should ask for clarification about what \"P\" is and what review is needed.\n\nActually, wait - let me reconsider. The cron message says \"until ack\" - this means I need to acknowledge that I've seen this reminder. But I don't know what \"P\" is. I should respond to acknowledge but also ask for clarification.\n\nActually, looking more carefully - this appears to be a test or automated message. The user context says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\" and \"Testing the OpenClaw platform integration - character creation flow E2E test.\"\n\nGiven this is an E2E test scenario, this cron might be part of the test. But I genuinely don't know what \"P\" refers to without more context. I should acknowledge and ask what needs to be reviewed.","thinkingSignature":"af9f2b0afe053c7717f9012f1aa8a4dfba92eb5caae00f957a046187aaffd6b7"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder about reviewing \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to or what review is needed.\n\nCould you clarify what \"P\" is and what specifically needs reviewing?
