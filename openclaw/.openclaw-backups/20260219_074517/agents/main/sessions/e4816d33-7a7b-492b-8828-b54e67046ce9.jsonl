Let me check if there's any context about who Ghazi is and what this call is about.\n\nLooking at my context, I see:\n- BOOTSTRAP.md is MISSING\n- HEARTBEAT.md has a reminder about reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM\n- This is a cron reminder about calling Ghazi\n\nI don't have information about who Ghazi is or what the call should be about. This seems to be a recurring reminder that was set up previously.\n\nSince this is a cron/recurring reminder and I don't have context about who Ghazi is or what the call should address, I should acknowledge this reminder. However, the instruction says \"Return your summary as plain text; it will be delivered automatically.\"\n\nWait - I need to think about this more carefully. This is a reminder for the USER, not from the user. It's saying \"Reminder: Call Ghazi (recurring until ACK)\". \n\nThe current time is 4:08 AM - quite early. The user is likely sleeping.\n\nI should return a summary noting this reminder but since it's 4 AM and this appears to be a test session (from USER.md - \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"), I should just acknowledge it.\n\nActually, re-reading the instructions: \"If the task explicitly calls for messaging a specific external recipient, note who/where it should go instead of sending it yourself.\"\n\nThis is a reminder TO the user (or for the user) to call Ghazi. I don't know who Ghazi is or have their contact info. I should just acknowledge this in my summary.","thinkingSignature":"36c5e4edd6729df43aed44ad3909387b7709b36ef483e1c03c5b7651a1756e0a"},{"type":"text","text":"Summary: Received recurring reminder to call Ghazi.
