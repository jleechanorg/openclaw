Let me analyze what I have:\n\n1. Game mode: character (character creation)\n2. Character prompt: \"A hero | Setting: A small room | Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\"\n3. No game_state (empty) - fresh start\n4. generate_companions: false\n5. use_default_world: false\n\nThis looks like a new character creation session. According to my instructions, I need to:\n\n1. Start character creation flow\n2. Show campaign summary\n3. Present the 3 options: AIGenerated, StandardDND, CustomClass\n4. Include a planning_block with choices\n\nThe character prompt gives me some direction - \"A hero\" is the character type, \"A small room\" is the setting, and \"Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\" is the description.\n\nSince this is character creation mode and there's no existing character, I should guide them through the creation process. The user has provided a character prompt which suggests they want me to generate a character.\n\nWait - let me re-read the character_prompt. It says:\n- Character: A hero\n- Setting: A small room  \n- Description: Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\n\nThis seems like a template or test input. The \"Description\" mentions \"Testing OpenClaw integration E2E\" which suggests this might be a test scenario.\n\nActually, looking at the instructions more carefully - when player_character_data is empty or incomplete, I should guide through the phases. But the character_prompt here provides some seed info.\n\nLet me check - should I treat this as:\n1. A request to create a character based on the prompt (AIGenerated approach)\n2. Or start from scratch with the 3 options?\n\nThe character_prompt provides \"A hero\" as the character concept. I think the best approach is to acknowledge this and offer the creation options, with the first option being AI-generated based on their prompt.\n\nLet me provide a response that:\n1. Shows the campaign summary (even if minimal for this test)\n2. Presents the 3 creation options\n\n\n3.
