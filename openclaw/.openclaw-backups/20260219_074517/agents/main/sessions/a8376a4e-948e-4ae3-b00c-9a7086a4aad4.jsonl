The cron is asking me to review something labeled \"P\".\n\nLet me check if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to. I don't have specific information about what \"P\" means in this context. It could be:\n- A PR (Pull Request) \n- A process\n- A pending item\n- Something specific to the testing\n\nSince this is a cron job and I don't have clear context about what \"P\" refers to, and the reminder says \"until ack\" (acknowledged), I should ask the user what they'd like me to review or check if there's more context.\n\nActually, let me check if there's any active session or recent context I should be aware of. Let me also check if there's a P0/P1/P2 style priority item or if this relates to something in the workspace.\n\nGiven the limited context, I should probably ask what \"P\" refers to so I can actually review it.","thinkingSignature":"ef46a45c2cf5a430497360396ffa51c09e055e8b18d76fd0149b6090416f919f"},{"type":"text","text":"\nI don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
