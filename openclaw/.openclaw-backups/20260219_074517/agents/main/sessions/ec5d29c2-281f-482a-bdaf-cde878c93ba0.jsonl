The air tastes of dust and candle wax and something older, something that clings to the back of the throat like a half-remembered dream.\\n\\nAric (Lvl 1) sits at a scarred oak reading table near the eastern alcove, surrounded by a fortress of open books. His fingers trace the faded ink of a genealogical treatise—the seventh such volume he's consulted this week—searching for references to a name that keeps appearing in the margins of unrelated texts: *Valdros Ashenmoor*. A cartographer. A heretic. A man who, three centuries ago, claimed to have mapped a place that shouldn't exist.\\n\\nThe library is nearly empty at this hour. A few robed acolytes drift between the shelves like sleepwalkers, and somewhere deeper in the stacks, the head librarian—an elderly woman named Tessara Quill (Lvl 3)—can be heard muttering to herself as she catalogs new acquisitions. The rhythmic scratch of her quill is the only constant sound.\\n\\nThen something catches Aric's eye. Pressed between the pages of the genealogy, thin as a whisper: a folded slip of parchment that doesn't belong. The paper is newer than the book by at least two hundred years, and someone has written on it in a hurried, slanted hand:\\n\\n*\\\"The Ashenmoor Index is real. Sub-level 4. Behind the Meridian Door. Do not let Tessara see you.\\\"*\\n\\nThe ink is still faintly damp.\\n\\nAric's pulse quickens. He glances toward the sound of Tessara's (Lvl 3) quill, then back at the note. Sub-level 4—he didn't even know the Athenaeum had a fourth sub-level. The deepest he's ever been granted access to is the second, and that required a formal petition signed by three senior scholars.\\n\\nSomeone left this note for him. Recently.
