Let me analyze the context:\n\n1. This is a browser test campaign for a D&D-style RPG\n2. The player character is Aric, a Level 1 Fighter (though the character concept says \"curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\")\n3. Current location: The Athenaeum of Whispers, a library\n4. The user previously asked to approach Librarian Caelindis and inquire about the restricted section\n5. Caelindis gave a response about the Forbidden/Forgotten Depository and the Council of Scrolls\n6. The user sent \"Start Adventure\" as their action\n\nWait, let me re-read. The user_action is \"Start Adventure\" but looking at the story_history, the last exchange was the user asking to approach Caelindis, and gemini responding with Caelindis's answer. Then the user said \"Start Adventure\" - but that seems inconsistent with the flow.\n\nActually, looking more carefully:\n- sequence_id 5: User says \"Approach Librarian Caelindis - Politely inquire about the restricted section...\"\n- sequence_id 6: Gemini responds with the librarian interaction\n- Then user_action says \"Start Adventure\"\n\nI think \"Start Adventure\" might be a UI button the user clicked, but the actual context shows they were already in the middle of interacting with the librarian. The planning_block shows choices about how to respond to Caelindis.\n\nGiven the priority_instruction says to respond to user_action field, I should treat \"Start Adventure\" as the player wanting to continue/begin the adventure. But looking at the context, they were in the middle of a conversation with Caelindis.\n\nI think the most sensible interpretation is that \"Start Adventure\" is continuing from where they left off - they asked about the restricted section, Caelindis responded, and now they need to choose how to proceed. The planning_block already has 4 choices ready.\n\nLet me write a response that:\n1. Acknowledges they're at the library, having just spoken with Caelindis\n\n\n2. Provides options for how to proceed with their inquiry\n3. Maintains the immersive narrative style\n\nI'll craft a response that picks up from where the conversation left off, offering the player meaningful choices about how to engage with the librarian's information about the restricted section.","thinkingSignature":"17b15722c6f4a06f88942aebcbeb7eafc11133ca66be1f9c5f2f2089678af5e7"},{"type":"text","text":"Morning (09:15:00) in the Grand Atrium of The Athenaeum of Whispers—Caelindis awaits your response, her pale eyes patient but searching.
