Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md to see if there's anything related to \"P\" that needs attention.\n\nLooking at the HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n- It has a reminder for 5:00 PM about reviewing Cindil's cover letter\n\nBut this cron is specifically about \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\" - this seems to be a specific task that was set up separately. I don't have information about what \"P\" refers to in my context.\n\nSince this is a cron job (not a heartbeat), and it's asking me to review something specific \"P\", I should acknowledge this reminder. Without more context about what \"P\" is, I should ask for clarification or indicate I'm ready to review it once I know what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait - looking at the rules: \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\"\n\nBut this isn't a heartbeat - it's a cron job.
