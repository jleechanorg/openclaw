I should respond as the AI assistant, perhaps asking for context or responding helpfully.\n\nSince this is an E2E test and there's no specific scene context provided, I should acknowledge this is a test and ask what they need help with - or respond naturally if this is meant to be part of the test flow.\n\nGiven this is a test and the previous memory indicates character creation testing, I'll respond briefly and in character as Quill.","thinkingSignature":"03a9c579bde165ea517a7050e1a29268dc72e4f5cdcfa310885f7161af725196"},{"type":"text","text":"You find yourself in a quiet library, surrounded by tall bookshelves.
