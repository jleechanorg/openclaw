This seems like it could be a test message or a heartbeat poll. Let me check if this matches the heartbeat prompt.\n\nLooking at MEMORY.md, the heartbeat prompt is:\n\"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n\n\"Action 0\" doesn't match the heartbeat prompt, so this is likely just a test message or something else.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the project context, it only contains comments - no active tasks.\n\nSince this appears to be a test message (given the context mentions \"E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"), I should respond briefly or wait for more context. However, the instructions say to reply with NO_REPLY if I have nothing useful to say.\n\nActually, \"Action 0\" could be:\n1. A test message for E2E testing\n2. Something else entirely\n\nGiven this is a test context and there's nothing specific to respond to, I should probably just acknowledge or ask what they need. But \"NO_REPLY\" would be appropriate if this is just a heartbeat poll that has no tasks.\n\nWait - this isn't the heartbeat prompt. It's just \"Action 0\". This seems like a test input. I should respond helpfully.\n\nLet me respond briefly to acknowledge I'm here and ready to help.","thinkingSignature":"437c2dc00a4eba18be3770bf0e67c864bf945ae84b14e0a566ed65dc1ba219e6"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Ready to help!
