NOT start a story - this is character building only\n2. ALWAYS provide choices\n3. Include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last choice\n\nSince there's no pre-populated character (game_state is empty), I should follow the Manual Character Creation Flow:\n- Phase 1: Concept - offer three creation methods (AI Generated, Standard D&D, Custom Class)\n\nThe character_prompt suggests they want \"A hero\" - this is very basic. I should guide them through the creation process.\n\nLet me provide the three options as specified in the instructions.","thinkingSignature":"2c5b47fb8ca4325dfe3574c807dd90f06b2c2d275ba2fda348327a8d035784c4"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_w9kv8uym87dd_1","name":"write","arguments":{"content":"{\n  \"session_header\": \"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: N/A (Character Creation)\\nLocation: Character Creation\\nStatus: Creating New Character\",\n  \"narrative\": \"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\\n\\nYou're starting a new adventure!
