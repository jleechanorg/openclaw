Let me analyze what's being sent:\n\n- `game_mode`: \"character\" - This indicates character creation mode\n- `character_prompt`: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: Browser test campaign\"\n- `generate_companions`: false\n- `game_state`: {} (empty)\n- `world_data`: {} (empty)\n\nThis is a fresh character creation request. Based on the AGENTS.md and character_creation_instruction.md files in the context:\n\n1. I need to detect that this is a character creation flow (game_mode = \"character\")\n2. I should start the character creation flow with the AI Generated method since there's a character prompt provided\n3. I need to follow the required format with planning_block containing choices\n\nLet me check what phase this should be. The user provided a character prompt with specific details:\n- Character concept: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nAccording to the character creation flow in AGENTS.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - they've already provided this\n- Since they provided a character prompt, I should likely use the AI Generated approach\n\nLooking at the character_prompt format: \"Character: [description] | Setting: [setting] | Description: [campaign desc]\"\n\nThis gives me enough to generate a character. Let me proceed with:\n1. Acknowledge the character prompt\n2. Generate a character using the AI Generated method based on the prompt\n3. Present the character for review\n4. Provide the required choices (edit or start)\n\nLet me create the character:\n- Race: Could be Human (scholar theme fits)\n- Class: Wizard (seeking forgotten knowledge fits lore master archetype)\n- Background: Sage (fits the scholar theme)\n\n\n- Name: I need to create an original name avoiding the restricted list from the prompt files. I'll choose something that fits the scholarly, curious archetype—something like Aldric or Caelum would work well for a wizard seeking ancient knowledge.\n\nFor ability scores using the standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8), I'll prioritize INT for spellcasting, then WIS for knowledge skills, with remaining scores distributed to support the character's mental focus and basic physical resilience.","thinkingSignature":"3a9d1ac678f8f680d0900f0e7483f8d9d156adb80abab2d8d9808bef62480d12"},{"type":"text","text":"[Mode: CHARACTER CREATION]\n\n[CHARACTER CREATION - AI Generated]\n\nBased on your character prompt, I've generated a scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in an ancient library setting.\n\n**Character Generated:**\n\n**Name:** Caelum Ashford  \n**Race:** Human  \n**Class:** Wizard (Lore Master) - Level 1  \n**Background:** Sage\n\n**Ability Scores:**\n- STR 10 (+0)\n- DEX 12 (+1)\n- CON 14 (+2)\n- INT 16 (+3)\n- WIS 14 (+2)\n- CHA 8 (-1)\n\n**Why This Character:** Caelum is a human wizard driven by an insatiable curiosity about lost arcane knowledge.
