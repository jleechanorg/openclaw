Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md and the workspace to understand what needs to be reviewed.\n\nLooking at my context, I see HEARTBEAT.md has been provided in the project context. Let me check if there's anything specific about \"P\" that needs review.\n\nFrom HEARTBEAT.md in the context:\n```\n# HEARTBEAT.md\n\n# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\n\n# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\n```\n\nThe file is essentially empty - just comments. There's no specific task about reviewing \"P\".\n\nThis seems to be a cron job that was set up previously, but the HEARTBEAT.md doesn't contain any active tasks. The cron is firing every 10 minutes asking to \"review P until ack\" but there's no context about what \"P\" is.\n\nI should respond indicating I don't have enough context about what \"P\" refers to. I could check session logs or ask the user, but given this is a cron and I have no clear task, I should probably just acknowledge and ask for clarification.\n\nWait - let me think about this differently. The cron says \"review-p-every-10m\" - this could be related to a pull request review, a document called \"P\", or something else entirely. Without more context, I can't act meaningfully.\n\nI'll respond that I need more context about what \"P\" refers to in order to review it.","thinkingSignature":"3c83635c7f385e930d4c7a0e02849eca76a9ec19ef246eb55d0d5936067448b5"},{"type":"text","text":"I see this cron is set to remind me to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
