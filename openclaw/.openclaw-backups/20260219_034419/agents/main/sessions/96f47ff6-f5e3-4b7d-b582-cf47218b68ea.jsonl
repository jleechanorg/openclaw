Let me check if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to or if there's something specific I need to look at.\n\nLooking at the workspace files provided, I don't see any specific context about what \"P\" refers to. This seems to be a cron reminder that was set up previously, but without context about what \"P\" is, I should acknowledge it and ask for clarification about what needs to be reviewed.\n\nWait - let me re-read the instructions. The heartbeat prompt says:\n\"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n\nAnd HEARTBEAT.md says:\n\"# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\"\n\nSo there's nothing specific in HEARTBEAT.md. This appears to be a cron job with a reminder about \"P\" but no context about what P is. Without context about what \"P\" refers to, I cannot provide meaningful review.\n\nHowever, this isn't a heartbeat - it's a cron job. The message says \"[cron:f44e55e8-2af2-4e8a-91c3-4d64842eceb0 review-p-every-10m]\".\n\nI should respond appropriately. Since there's no context about what \"P\" is and no specific task in HEARTBEAT.md, I should acknowledge this is a cron but ask what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"1446ad884b28299801e71ee8eaaedc25bf111d16b2cbb9d38c23e42b9d5091f9"},{"type":"text","text":"I see this is a cron reminder to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
