Based on my AGENTS.md guidelines about heartbeats - I should stay quiet during late night hours (23:00-08:00) unless it's urgent.\n\nThis cron reminder doesn't appear to be urgent - it's just asking to review something, and the previous attempts already asked for clarification about what \"P\" is.\n\nI should reply HEARTBEAT_OK since:\n1.

The cron is set to \"review-p-every-10m\" - this appears to be a recurring reminder to review something called \"P\".\n\nGiven:\n- It's 6:07 AM (early morning)\n- No context about what \"P\" is\n- Previous cron already asked for clarification\n\nI should acknowledge this but note that I still don't know what \"P\" refers to. However, since the user might be sleeping, maybe I should just stay quiet.\n\nActually, let me be more helpful. The user set up this cron for a reason - they want to review something every 10 minutes. Even if I don't know what \"P\" is, I should at least check if there's anything that might be \"P\" related in the recent activity.\n\nLooking at the sessions, there's browser test game activity. Maybe \"P\" is related to that? Let me check if there's any other context I can find.\n \nI'll follow the guidance from previous sessions. The cron has already attempted to clarify the purpose of \"P\" multiple times without success. Since it's early morning and no new information has emerged, I'll send a brief acknowledgment. This approach maintains the pattern of minimal disruption during nighttime hours while keeping the reminder active for future clarification.","thinkingSignature":"b84ab104b9b1a7e207571f0d61e70552aea5d9c153619c8b9194601fc403652d"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":7107,"output":503,"cacheRead":7475,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":15085,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771337298153}}
