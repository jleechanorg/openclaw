Now they're sending Action 2\n\nSince this is a test and they've been giving me simple action commands, I should respond appropriately. There's no specific question or request here - it's just \"Action 2\" which seems to be part of a test sequence.\n\nLooking at my guidelines, I should respond when asked something or when I can add value. This is just a test action. I should acknowledge it and be ready for the next step.\n\nI'll give a brief, practical response.","thinkingSignature":"81935dc6d7019ff0d2b5feb89ed74204e67c561a9f2d95b9dfabd17ba98c16fc"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Ready for Action 3.</final>"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":191,"cacheRead":7455,"cacheWrite":62,"totalTokens":7720,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771400721593}}
