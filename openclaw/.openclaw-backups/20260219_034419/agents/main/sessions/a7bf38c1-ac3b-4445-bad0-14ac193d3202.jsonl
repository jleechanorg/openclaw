They've provided:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nThis is a character creation prompt, so I need to follow the character creation instruction flow. Looking at the instructions:\n\n1. This is a new campaign - character_prompt is provided but not a full character sheet\n2. I need to follow the character creation flow from character_creation_instruction.md\n\nLet me check what phase we're in. The user has given me a character concept - \"curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" in a library setting. This seems like they want me to generate a character.\n\nLooking at the character_creation_instruction.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - they already provided a concept\n- Phase 2: Mechanics - need to build the character\n- Phase 3: Personality (optional)\n- Phase 4: Completion\n\nSince they provided a character prompt with concept, I should:\n1. Acknowledge the concept\n2. Ask what creation method they want (AIGenerated, StandardDND, or CustomClass)\n3. Present choices\n\nActually, looking more carefully - they gave me a character prompt that includes the character description. This is different from a full character sheet. \n\nLet me re-read the instructions. The character_prompt field contains: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: Browser test campaign\"\n\nThis seems like they want me to create a character based on this prompt. According to the instructions, when there's a character prompt but no full character data, I should proceed with character creation.\n\nLet me generate a character based on this concept. A curious scholar in a library setting suggests:\n- Race: Probably human, half-elf, or tiefling for a scholar vibe\n- Class: Wizard makes sense for a scholar, maybe rogue for knowledge seeker, or bard\n- Background: Sage, scholar, or academic\n\n\n- I'll present three distinct paths for character development, each offering a unique approach to bringing this scholarly character to life.","thinkingSignature":"3bbbdad9e9445e9f8a38bf6ed9f7b52cad6e89fa46bc5500f2f82c15aaa98e0d"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept Received]\n\nYou've chosen to create **a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge** in **a quiet library filled with ancient tomes**. \n\nThis is a browser test campaign, so I'll generate a character that fits this scholarly concept.\n\n---\n\n**What type of character would you like?**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"User provided a character concept (curious scholar) and setting (library).
