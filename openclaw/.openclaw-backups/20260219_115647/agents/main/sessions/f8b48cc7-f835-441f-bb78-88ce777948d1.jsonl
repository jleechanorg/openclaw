This seems like an E2E test input for the character creation flow. Looking at the context:\n\n1. This is an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation\n2. From MEMORY.md, I can see this is Session 3 (E2E Test)\n3. A character was generated: Caelum Ashford, Human Wizard (Lore Master) Level 1\n4. The character was presented for review and awaiting user confirmation\n\n\"Action 0\" appears to be a test input - likely selecting an option. Looking at typical test scenarios, this could be:\n- First option in a choice list\n- A \"start\" or \"continue\" command\n\nGiven the flow:\n- Character was generated and presented for review\n- The choices presented were likely \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nSince \"Action 0\" seems to be selecting the first option, and the last choice is \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\", I need to figure out what \"Action 0\" corresponds to.\n\nLooking at the AGENTS.md instructions for god mode template review, it says to provide exactly two choices:\n1. \"Edit Character\" \n2. \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nIf these are presented in order, \"Action 0\" would select the first option, which is \"Edit Character\".\n\nWait, but I don't see a choice list in this message. Let me reconsider. The user sent \"Action 0\" which is likely triggering a selection in the test flow.\n\nGiven this is an E2E test and the character was presented for review, the most likely scenario is that \"Action 0\" means \"select option 0\" from the choices. If the choices are ordered with Edit first, then Action 0 would be Edit.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instructions more carefully. In the god mode section:\n\"Provide EXACTLY these two choices\" with edit_character first and start_adventure second.\n\n\nI'll proceed with selecting the first option, which appears to be \"Edit Character\". This aligns with the test flow of starting with editing options when a character is presented for review.","thinkingSignature":"8b81ccf195237a057edffadf4ca9ee52fc9007629b933c03a700850d3711f38c"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_fue34xpcar2u_1","name":"memory_search","arguments":{"query":"character creation flow E2E test choices"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":480,"cacheRead":7225,"cacheWrite":8,"totalTokens":7725,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771499558647}}
