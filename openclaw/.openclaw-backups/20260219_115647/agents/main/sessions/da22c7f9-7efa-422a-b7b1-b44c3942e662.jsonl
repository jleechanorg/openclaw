There's no specific task or question here, just what seems like a test input.\n\nLooking at the context:\n- This is an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation\n- The previous session was about a scholar in a library setting\n- The runtime shows model=minimax-portal/MiniMax-M2.5\n\nSince this is a test and there's no specific action requested, I should respond appropriately. The message \"Action 1\" doesn't specify what action to take. I should ask for clarification about what they want me to do.\n\nActually, wait - this could be a heartbeat message or a test message. Let me check the HEARTBEAT.md - it has a reminder about reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5 PM, but no indication this is a heartbeat poll.\n\nThis seems like a test message. I should respond in a helpful way asking what they'd like to do, similar to my previous \"Ready for action\" response.","thinkingSignature":"02eb6d585e05b8828bd94b42c155259acf2708ee89900aae472996bfe2747cfe"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>What action would you like me to take?</final>"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":246,"cacheRead":7790,"cacheWrite":48,"totalTokens":8096,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771483577444}}
