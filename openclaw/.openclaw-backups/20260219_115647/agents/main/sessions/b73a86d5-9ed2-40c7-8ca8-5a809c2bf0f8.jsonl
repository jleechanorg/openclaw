Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md to understand what needs to be done.\n\nLooking at the workspace context, HEARTBEAT.md contains:\n```\n# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\n\n# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\n```\n\nIt appears to be empty (just comments), so there's no specific task defined for \"P\". The message says \"review P (every 10 min until ack)\" but without context about what \"P\" is, I should ask for clarification or check if there's more context.\n\nWait - this is a cron job reminder, not a regular heartbeat. The cron is asking me to review something called \"P\". Since HEARTBEAT.md doesn't have specific instructions about \"P\", and I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to, I should respond that I need more information about what \"P\" is and what reviewing it entails.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instructions. The heartbeat prompt says to follow HEARTBEAT.md strictly. HEARTBEAT.md is empty (just comments), so there's nothing specific to do. I should reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\n\nBut wait - the cron message itself contains the task: \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\". This is different from the standard heartbeat. This is a specific cron job asking me to review something.\n\nWithout more context about what \"P\" is, I cannot meaningfully review it. I should indicate that I need clarification on what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"c142717bcc0dbb599be6bfb5e7a5aa1ab62861b24a97e82d8f73ddcbda646fa4"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK\n\nI don't have enough context to review \"P\" — what's P supposed to be?
