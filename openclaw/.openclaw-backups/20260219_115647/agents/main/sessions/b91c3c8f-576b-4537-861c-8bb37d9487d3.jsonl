The air is thick with the scent of aged parchment, binding glue, and the faintest trace of pipe tobacco left behind by scholars long departed.\\n\\nAric (Lvl 1) sits at a reading desk near the back of the great hall, surrounded by towers of leather-bound volumes. His fingers trace the embossed title of a crumbling bestiary—*Taxonomy of the Fell and Forgotten, Third Revised Edition*—but the words swim before his eyes. He has been here since before dawn, chasing a thread he found three days ago: a marginal note in an otherwise unremarkable treatise on herbalism, scrawled in faded violet ink.\\n\\n*\\\"The Ossuary Index was never destroyed. It was moved. Ask the dust where it sleeps.\\\"*\\n\\nThe Ossuary Index. A catalog rumored to contain the locations of every forbidden text seized and hidden by the Censors of Oghma during the Spellplague. If it exists, it would be the key to a lifetime of lost knowledge—entire schools of thought, erased histories, suppressed magical theory. The kind of discovery that scholars kill for. Or die for.\\n\\nA floorboard creaks somewhere among the shelves to the east. Aric glances up. The library should be empty at this hour—old Keeper Dulmund (Lvl 2) doesn't unlock the public wing until the ninth bell, and the private collection where Aric sits requires a researcher's writ that few bother to obtain.\\n\\nAnother creak. Closer now. Then the unmistakable sound of a book being pulled from a shelf, slowly, deliberately—as if someone is trying very hard not to be heard.\\n\\nFrom the opposite direction, near the arched entrance to the restricted stacks, a folded piece of parchment lies on the floor that Aric is certain was not there when he arrived. It must have been slipped beneath the iron gate sometime in the last hour.\\n\\nThe morning light shifts. Dust motes spiral lazily in the silence.
