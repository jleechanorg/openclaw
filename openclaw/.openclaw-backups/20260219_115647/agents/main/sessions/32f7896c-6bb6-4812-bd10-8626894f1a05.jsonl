Let me check HEARTBEAT.md for context since it was mentioned in the runtime context.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThis is a reminder to review something. The cron message says \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\" - so I need to figure out what \"P\" refers to. Based on HEARTBEAT.md, it seems like there's a pending task to review something.\n\nWait - this seems to be a test E2E session. Looking at MEMORY.md:\n- Test user: test-openclaw_settings_e2e-1771500623\n- Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\n\nThis appears to be a test cron/reminder. Let me check if there's anything specific about \"P\" that I should know about. Without more context, I should acknowledge this is a reminder but I don't have enough information about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nActually, looking at the reminder message more carefully: \"Review P (every 10 min until ack)\" - this seems to be asking me to acknowledge a reminder. Since this appears to be a test session and I don't have clear information about what \"P\" refers to in this context, I should respond that I don't know what \"P\" is and ask for clarification.\n\nBut wait - this could be a test cron job. Let me think about what the appropriate response is. The user is running E2E tests. This cron reminder seems to be a test to see if I respond to heartbeats properly.\n\nGiven the context:\n1. This is an E2E test session\n2. The reminder says \"Review P\" \n3. I don't have info about what \"P\" is\n\nI should acknowledge I received the reminder but need clarification on what \"P\" is.","thinkingSignature":"b551f746027a8fe6a6080f0016f0686b4b6c435d08d8e898445825bc60a51958"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to \"Review P\" but I don't have context on what \"P\" refers to.
