The user is starting a new character creation session with specific parameters:\n\n1. **Game mode**: character (character creation mode)\n2. **User ID**: browser-test-1771524925\n3. **Character prompt**: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n4. **Setting**: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n5. **Generate companions**: false (no companions)\n6. **Use default world**: false\n\nThis is a character creation flow. According to my instructions in character_creation_instruction.md and AGENTS.md:\n\n1. I should NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. I need to provide choices in every response\n3. I should use the `[CHARACTER CREATION - <stage>]` tag in narrative\n4. The character prompt gives me the theme: curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n5. The setting gives me context for the campaign\n\nLooking at the character_prompt provided:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\n\nThis is a unique campaign - the user wants to create a scholar character in a library setting. This is an E2E test for OpenClaw, so I should follow the character creation flow properly.\n\nAccording to the character creation flow in AGENTS.md:\n- Phase 1: Concept - I've already got the concept from the prompt\n- Phase 2: Mechanics - I need to guide through race → class → abilities → equipment\n- Phase 3: Personality - Optional\n- Phase 4: Completion - Final approval\n\nWait - the character_prompt already gives me a concept. Let me re-read the flow more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the system prompt and AGENTS.md more carefully:\n\n> **Phase 1: Concept (What kind of character?)**\n\n\n> - Offer three creation methods:\n>   - `ai_generated`: \"AI Generated\" - Let AI create a character based on theme\n>   - `standard_dnd`: \"Standard D&D\" - Traditional step-by-step creation\n>   - `custom_class`: \"Custom Class\" - Design a custom class\n\nThe user has provided a character concept in the prompt, but I still need to ask which creation method they prefer since this is character creation mode. I should present the three options and use the `[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]` tag in my response.\n\nThe campaign details tell me this is a scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in a library setting, which is an E2E test for OpenClaw. This gives me the thematic direction, but I still need to follow the creation flow and ask them to choose between AI-generated, standard D&D, or custom class creation.","thinkingSignature":"d8dcdc3fcd54547e0639a661680a72d16c999b21f673e76a8b809f0f44c559cb"},{"type":"toolCall","id":"call_function_ijskqcnv2f8y_1","name":"read","arguments":{"file_path":"/Users/jleechan/IDENTITY.md"}}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":622,"cacheRead":69444,"cacheWrite":0,"totalTokens":70078,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"toolUse","timestamp":1771524951950}}
