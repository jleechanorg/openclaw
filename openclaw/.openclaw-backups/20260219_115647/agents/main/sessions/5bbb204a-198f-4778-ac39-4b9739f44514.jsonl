Let me check what's happening with this - I need to understand what \"P\" refers to.\n\nLooking at the cron message, it seems like there's a task to review something (P) every 10 minutes. This is likely related to my human's E2E testing work for OpenClaw character creation.\n\nSince HEARTBEAT.md only has comments and no active tasks, and this is a cron job (not a heartbeat), I should check if there's anything specific I need to do. The message says \"review-p-every-10m\" which suggests reviewing something.\n\nI don't have context about what \"P\" is. I should acknowledge and ask what needs to be reviewed, or check if there's more context in the workspace.\n\nWait - this is a cron job that expects acknowledgment. The format suggests it's asking me to review something. Without more context about what \"P\" is, I should ask the user what they'd like me to review.\n\nActually, looking at the rules: \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\"\n\nSince this is a cron job asking me to review something and I don't know what \"P\" refers to, I should respond asking for clarification about what needs to be reviewed.","thinkingSignature":"ce632a638c1ec23b23405169d904c4223e570bf564254b3c171e795a3653d3a3"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I'm not sure what \"P\" refers to.
