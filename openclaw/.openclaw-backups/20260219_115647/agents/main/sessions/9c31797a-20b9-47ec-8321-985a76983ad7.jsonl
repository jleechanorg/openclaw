The user_action says \"Start Adventure\" but looking at the story_history, they've already been adventuring - they found the reference to \"The Seventeen Silences\" and the librarian Thalindor is acting suspicious. The planning_block already has choices set up.\n\nBut wait - let me check the user's actual message. The user_action is \"Start Adventure\" - this seems to be from sequence_id 3 where the user selected \"Start Adventure\". But that was already processed in sequence_id 4.\n\nHmm, let me re-read the priority_instruction: \"CRITICAL: Respond to user_action field, NOT story_history or game_state entries. story_history and game_state are context only. Focus exclusively on current user_action.\"\n\nSo the user_action is \"Start Adventure\". But that was already responded to in sequence_id 4. Let me look at the checkpoint_block - it shows sequence_id 6, location is The Whispering Archives, mission is \"Find the Lost Codex\".\n\nActually wait - I think the issue is that this might be a replay or the user is selecting from the planning_block choices. Looking at the planning_block, it has 4 choices:\n1. Confront Thalindor\n2. Sneak to Restricted Section  \n3. Research the Catalog\n4. Watch and Wait\n\nThe user_action says \"Start Adventure\" which is what they selected to begin the game. But the story has already progressed past that. \n\nActually, I'm confused. Let me re-read more carefully.\n\nThe sequence is:\n1. User created character in god mode\n\n\n2. User said \"Start Adventure\" \n3. Gemini responded with initial scene\n4. User chose \"Research Public Stacks\"\n5. Gemini described the research results and set up the planning_block with 4 choices\n\nNow looking at the user_action field again: it says \"Start Adventure\" but this seems to be stale data from an earlier message. The actual current state shows sequence_id 6 with the planning_block choices available. Given the context, I think the user might be trying to make a choice from the planning_block options, but the user_action field isn't correctly reflecting that selection.\n\nLooking at what happened: the user researched the public stacks and discovered \"The Seventeen Silences,\" with Thalindor acting suspiciously. The planning_block now presents four options. Since the user_action field is \"Start Adventure\" but the story is clearly at a different point, I should respond as if the user is continuing from where they left off and either ask them to choose from the available options or interpret this as them selecting one of the planning_block choices based on the context of what they've already done.\n\nThe mission is clear: find the lost codex. They discovered a reference to \"The Seventeen Silences\" in the restricted section. I'll present the four options to them since that's what makes sense given the current state, rather than repeating what they've already done.","thinkingSignature":"4f43b6fb9bfd7606e5a0666beb88246d848a632b8920c7ee1535d2a1ace455ab"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>\nMorning (09:00:00) in the Whispering Archives—Thalindor quickly looks away as your eyes meet, his fingers resuming their nervous drumming against the desk.
