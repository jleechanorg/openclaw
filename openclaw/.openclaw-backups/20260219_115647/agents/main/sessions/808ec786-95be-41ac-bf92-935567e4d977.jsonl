Looking at the context:\n\n1. This is an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation\n2. The user has provided a character prompt: \"Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. | Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes | Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\"\n3. The game_mode is \"character\" - so I'm in character creation mode\n4. There's no pre-existing character data - I need to guide them through creation\n\nAccording to the character_creation_instruction.md, I should:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last choice\n\nThe user has given me a character prompt with:\n- Character concept: curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: quiet library with ancient tomes\n- Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test\n\nSince there's no pre-existing character, I should follow the Manual Character Creation Flow:\n- Phase 1: Concept - they've already given me a concept\n- Phase 2: Mechanics - build the character\n- Phase 3: Personality (optional)\n- Phase 4: Completion\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the input - there's no `player_character_data` at all. The game_state is empty. So I need to start from scratch.\n\nBut wait - the user HAS provided a character prompt. According to the template review section:\n\"When you receive a **pre-populated character** from a campaign template\"\n\nBut there's no actual character data in game_state - just a character_prompt string. This is different.\n\nLet me re-read the instructions... The character_prompt contains:\n- Character: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes  \n- Description: OpenClaw browser lifecycle test campaign\n\nI think I should interpret this as the user wanting me to create a character based on this prompt. \n\nI need to determine whether this counts as a pre-populated template or if I'm starting fresh. The distinction matters because the instructions differentiate between receiving actual character data versus receiving a concept prompt. Since game_state is empty but character_prompt exists, I should probably offer the standard creation options rather than assume I'm working from a completed template.\n\nLooking at the workflow, when nothing exists yet I should present the three paths: AI-generated, standard D&D, or custom class. The user's prompt gives me enough to work with—a scholar in a library seeking forgotten knowledge—but I still need them to choose which creation method they want before proceeding.","thinkingSignature":"fc3f4059e539415fd0a9da6627c8ae22620f59b4395618bf25f453cdcec4a5dd"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nI've received your character concept: a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge, set in a quiet library filled with ancient tomes.\n\nBefore I build your character, I need to know how you'd like to create it.\n\n**Option 1: AI Generated**\nI'll create a complete character based on your scholar concept — race, class, abilities, equipment, and background all in one go.\n\n**Option 2: Standard D&D**\nI'll guide you step-by-step through race → class → ability scores → background → equipment.\n\n**Option 3: Custom Class**\nYou want something non-standard — a custom class or unconventional concept.\n\nWhich approach would you like?\n\n[CHARACTER CREATION - Choose Method]\n\n```json\n{\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"User provided a character concept (curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge) but no pre-built character.
