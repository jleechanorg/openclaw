I should respond in character as an AI assistant helping with this场景, describing what they might see if they're creating a character in some kind of game or D&D-like setting.\n\nLet me think about what environment would make sense. Based on MEMORY.md, the first session was \"a scholar in a library setting\" - so this might be a similar character creation flow.\n\nI should describe a scene for them to react to, like a GM would.
