The user has provided a character prompt about a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library setting.\n\nLet me analyze what I need to do:\n\n1. This is a character creation flow (game_mode: \"character\")\n2. The character prompt specifies: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" in \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n3. This is for browser testing E2E (from USER.md)\n\nHowever, looking at the project context, I have several files loaded that give me instructions:\n- master_directive.md\n- game_state_instruction.md\n- dice_system_instruction.md\n- character_creation_instruction.md\n- dnd_srd_instruction.md\n- mechanics_system_instruction.md\n\nThe character_creation_instruction.md specifically says I should:\n1. NOT start the story - this is character building only\n2. Provide choices in every response\n3. Guide through concept → mechanics → personality → completion\n4. Include \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" as the last choice\n\nBut wait - looking at the character_prompt provided, the user has already specified:\n- Character concept: A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\n- Setting: A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\n- Description: Browser test campaign\n\nThis looks like the user has provided a character concept. According to the character_creation_instruction.md, when receiving a pre-populated character or clear character concept, I should:\n\n1. Present the character for review\n2. Ask for confirmation\n3. Provide choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nHowever, I notice the game_state is empty ({}), which means there's no pre-built character. The user is providing a character concept via the prompt.\n\nLooking at the character_creation_instruction.md more carefully:\n- \"When player_character_data is empty or incomplete, guide through these phases\"\n\n\n- Phase 1: Concept (What kind of character?) - The user has already provided this!\n- Phase 2: Mechanics (Build the character)\n- Phase 3: Personality (Optional)\n- Phase 4: Completion\n\nSince the user has given me a clear character concept in the prompt, I should:\n1. Acknowledge and confirm the character concept\n2. Move to Phase 2: Mechanics - guide them through building the character (race, class, abilities, etc.)\n3. Provide choices for each step\n\nLet me start by presenting the concept back to the user and then guide them through the mechanics of character creation.\n\nI need to follow the required format from the instructions. Looking at the example in character_creation_instruction.md, I should use:\n- `narrative` with the [CHARACTER CREATION - <stage>] tag\n- `planning_block` with choices\n- `state_updates` to track progress\n\nBut wait - I need to understand what output format is expected. Looking at the game_state_instruction.md, responses should be in JSON format with specific fields. However, the character_creation_instruction.md shows a more flexible markdown-like format. Let me check which one applies here.\n\nActually, looking at character_creation_instruction.md more carefully, it shows a JSON-like example with \"narrative\", \"planning_block\", and \"state_updates\" fields. So I should output JSON.\n\nBut there's a problem - I don't have the tool_requests or other fields that would be needed for a complete response. Looking at the input, it's just a JSON object describing the character creation request.\n\nI think the issue is that this is the initial character creation request, and I need to start the flow. Let me provide a response that:\n1. Acknowledges the character concept\n2. Starts the mechanics phase (since concept is provided)\n3. Provides choices for how to proceed with building the character\n\nThe user provided \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\" as the character concept. The setting is \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\".\n\nI should present this and then offer options for how to create the character - either let me (AI) generate it, or guide them through standard D&D creation, or custom.","thinkingSignature":"7eb1e272c7bc42b79ebaab77309df0906575daf88c56b52ea3d61d1febfb15fa"},{"type":"text","text":"{\"session_header\":\"[SESSION_HEADER]\\nTimestamp: 1492 DR, Mirtul 1, 08:00:00\\nLocation: Character Creation\\nStatus: Creating New Character\",\"narrative\":\"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept Confirmed]\\n\\nYou've chosen to create a **curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge** in a **quiet library filled with ancient tomes** setting.\\n\\nThis sounds like an intriguing character concept!
