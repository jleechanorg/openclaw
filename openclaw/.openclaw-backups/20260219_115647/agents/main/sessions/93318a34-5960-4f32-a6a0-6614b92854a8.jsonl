Results on 10 val examples: 0% exact match, 0% semantic match (cosine >0.85), 50% intent match, 50% miss. Score 0.25/1.0. Model over-predicts generic confirmations ('ok run it'). Train loss 1.831, val loss 1.934 after 600 iterations. Questions: (1) Is 50% intent / 0% semantic viable starting point or dead end? (2) Is 1,186 examples enough or need 10x-100x more? (3) Is 1.5B big enough? (4) Best architectural change: RAG, classifier head, MoE? (5) Pivot to intent classification only instead of free-text? (6) What accuracy threshold for pre-caching utility? (7) Training improvements: data augmentation, loss weighting, LoRA hyperparams? Be direct about viability."}],"timestamp":1771130655237}}
