The cron message mentions \"review-p-every-10m\" which seems to be a periodic reminder about something called \"P\".\n\nI don't see anything specific about \"P\" in HEARTBEAT.md. The reminder there is for 5:00 PM which hasn't arrived yet.\n\nSince this appears to be a test/automated cron message about reviewing something called \"P\" every 10 minutes, and there's no actual task in HEARTBEAT.md that needs attention right now (the only reminder is for 5:00 PM), I should acknowledge this is a heartbeat poll but there's nothing needing attention at this moment.","thinkingSignature":"d4df4eb42e36606a8b9f7f095c0ab63467775e29606200b6aeac28ec6cc77526"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":231,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7267,"totalTokens":7510,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771528670334}}
