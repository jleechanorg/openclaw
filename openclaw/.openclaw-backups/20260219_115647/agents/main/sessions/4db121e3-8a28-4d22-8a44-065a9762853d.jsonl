This appears to be a separate cron job/reminder that was set up previously.\n\nSince this is asking me to remind the user about calling Ghazi (recurring), and there's no other context about who Ghazi is or what the call is about, I should simply acknowledge this reminder. The user likely needs to be notified about this recurring task.\n\nGiven this is a reminder and not an action I need to take myself (like making a call), I should present this to the user as a reminder they need to handle.","thinkingSignature":"b55d4a9eb38dd4b08c889d4768aeee713fb99673ca4257e54a80dd66981e1db1"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":189,"cacheRead":7183,"cacheWrite":114,"totalTokens":7498,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771526902998}}
