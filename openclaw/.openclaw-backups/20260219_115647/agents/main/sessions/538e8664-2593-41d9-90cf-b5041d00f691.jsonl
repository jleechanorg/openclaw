Looking at HEARTBEAT.md, I see there's a task: \"[ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\"\n\nBut the current time is 7:07 AM, not 5:00 PM. Let me check if there's anything else in the workspace context about reviewing \"P\".\n\nThe cron message says \"review-p-every-10m\" - this seems to be about reviewing something called \"P\" periodically. I don't have enough context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nLooking at my context:\n- HEARTBEAT.md has a task for 5:00 PM to review Cindil's cover letter\n- But this is a 7:07 AM reminder about \"P\"\n\nI should check if there's more context about what \"P\" is. Since I don't have clear information about what \"P\" refers to in this context, I should acknowledge the heartbeat but indicate I don't know what \"P\" is without more context.\n\nActually, let me re-read the instructions. For heartbeats:\n- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK\n- If something needs attention, do NOT include \"HEARTBEAT_OK\"; reply with the alert text instead\n\nThe cron reminder says \"review-p-e\" -very-10m this seems like an active task that's been set up. The user set up this reminder, so something needs attention. But I don't know what \"P\" is.\n\nI should ask for clarification about what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"7adf97d74dce7880b161b0d920bb6cb3928142ae602ea68aee33b9518432a37e"},{"type":"text","text":"I see a reminder to review \"P\" every 10 minutes, but I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
