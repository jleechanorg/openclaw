The only reminder is for 5:00 PM which hasn't arrived yet.\n\nAccording to my instructions:\n- If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK\n- If something needs attention, do NOT include \"HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nThere's nothing in HEARTBEAT.md that needs attention right now (the 5:00 PM task is not yet due).
