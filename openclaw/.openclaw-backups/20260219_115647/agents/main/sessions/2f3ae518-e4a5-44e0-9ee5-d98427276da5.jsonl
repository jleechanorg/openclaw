Looking at the context, I'm in \"GM\" mode for a group chat, and this appears to be an E2E test for OpenClaw's character creation flow. \n\nHowever, the user is now saying \"I look around the room\" which sounds like they're trying to start a narrative/adventure, not continue character creation.\n\nBut wait - I'm in CHARACTER CREATION mode according to AGENTS.md. The last memory says:\n- \"Awaiting user confirmation (edit or start)\"\n- \"Character generated\"\n- \"Waiting for user approval\"\n\nThe user needs to either:\n1. Edit the character\n2. Finish character creation and start the game\n\nBut they're now describing looking around a room - which sounds like they want to START the adventure. This is confusing because they haven't confirmed the character yet.\n\nLet me re-read the instructions... According to AGENTS.md:\n- \"For god mode templates: Present pre-made character for review\"\n- \"For manual creation: Guide through concept → mechanics → personality → completion\"\n- \"Do NOT start the story - this is character building only\"\n\nSo I should NOT start the story. The user needs to confirm the character first. But they're acting like they're already in the game.\n\nThis could be:\n1. A test that's moving forward without proper character confirmation\n2. The user wanting to skip ahead\n3. Confusion about the mode\n\nGiven this is an E2E test, I should probably present the character for review again and get confirmation before proceeding. The character \"Caelum Ashford\" was generated but not confirmed.\n\nActually, wait - looking at the instruction more carefully:\n- For god mode templates: present for review with EXACTLY two choices\n- The finish choice should be \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nThe user's action \"I look around the room\" is attempting to play the game before character confirmation. I should redirect them to confirm the character first.\n\nLet me present the character again and ask for confirmation.","thinkingSignature":"dc4828442813eeaab550917c52265872cd183b7f55ae465e6942793ea61c4a2c"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]\n\nI see you're ready to explore!
