This is a fairly open-ended question - they're likely wondering if transcript/features they might be using consume a lot of tokens.\n\nHowever, I don't have enough context about what \"these transcript generations\" specifically refers to. It could be:\n\n1. Something in their current conversation/thread\n2. A feature they're using in OpenClaw\n3. Something they're planning to use\n\nSince this is a direct message and they're asking a general question, I should just give a helpful answer about token usage for transcription in general, while noting I could be more specific if they clarify what they're referring to.\n\nAlso - I should check if HEARTBEAT.md has anything, but this seems like a regular message not a heartbeat.\n\nLet me keep this concise and helpful.","thinkingSignature":"3eb7e1d7d3106ffa177b4c1bf36f3110f426c6e49fca2643f58b9433f7006e91"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Hey Jeffrey!
