This is a character creation mode request (game_mode: \"character\")\n2. The user has provided a character concept: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n3. Setting: \"A quiet library filled with ancient tomes\"\n4. This is an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation flow\n\nAccording to my instructions in character_creation_instruction.md and AGENTS.md, when entering character creation mode:\n\n1. I should NOT start the story - this is meta-game only\n2. I need to provide choices in every response\n3. I should follow the manual character creation flow or recognize this has a pre-populated character concept\n\nLooking at the input, there's no pre-populated player_character_data - it's empty ({}). So I need to guide through character creation.\n\nThe character_prompt gives me the concept - a curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge. This is similar to a \"theme\" that could be used for AI-generated character creation.\n\nLet me follow the character creation flow:\n\n**Phase 1: Concept** - The user has provided: \"A curious scholar seeking forgotten knowledge\"\n- I should offer three creation methods:\n  - AI Generated (using the provided concept)\n  - Standard D&D (traditional step-by-step)\n  - Custom Class\n\nSince this is an E2E test and the user has provided a specific character concept, I should present the options and use the provided concept for the AI-generated path.\n\nLet me create the response following the required format:\n- Use tag: `[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]`\n- Include planning_block with choices\n- Include the required \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\" option","thinkingSignature":"07c2e15d4f6bbb9eba4c8e5732609d31315ce17da4f2a23f685b1121d6f92dba"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Concept]\n\nYou've chosen to create a **Curious Scholar** seeking forgotten knowledge in a quiet library setting.
