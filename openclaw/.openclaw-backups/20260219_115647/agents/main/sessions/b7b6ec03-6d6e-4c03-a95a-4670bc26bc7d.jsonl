Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md and see if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nLooking at the workspace context, HEARTBEAT.md contains:\n```\n# HEARTBEAT.md\n\n# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\n\n# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\n```\n\nIt's essentially empty with just comments. So there's no specific task defined for what \"P\" refers to.\n\nThis appears to be a periodic cron reminder that was set up previously, but the HEARTBEAT.md doesn't contain the details of what \"P\" is. Without more context about what \"P\" refers to (could be a person, project, file, task, etc.), I should acknowledge this is a reminder but I don't have enough information about what specifically needs to be reviewed.\n\nWait - let me re-read the instructions. The cron message says \"review-p-every-10m\" which suggests this is a scheduled task. But without knowing what \"P\" is, I can't meaningfully review anything.\n\nAccording to my guidelines: \"If something needs attention, do NOT include 'HEARTBEAT_OK'; reply with the alert text instead.\"\n\nBut I also don't have enough context to determine if this needs attention. Let me think - the cron job exists and is firing, so something was set up. But HEARTBEAT.md doesn't contain the details.\n\nI should ask for clarification about what \"P\" refers to, since I don't have enough information to do a meaningful review.","thinkingSignature":"b0140ab4797e4e129515ae79bd21dcf6d6ffa0b1cee3cbbd288e1b7479e4326b"},{"type":"text","text":"I see the reminder to \"review P every 10 min\" but I don't have context on what \"P\" refers to.
