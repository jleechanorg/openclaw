Looking at the context, I can see in HEARTBEAT.md there's a reminder:\n\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n\nBut the cron message says \"review-p-every-10m\" - this seems to be a periodic reminder. Let me check if there's more context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nGiven the HEARTBEAT.md shows a todo about reviewing Cindil's cover letter at 5:00 PM, but the current time is 9:47 AM, that task isn't due yet.\n\nThe cron message appears to be a test or automated reminder. Since there's nothing specific in HEARTBEAT.md that needs attention right now (the 5:00 PM task isn't due), I should acknowledge this is a heartbeat and respond appropriately.\n\nWait - looking more carefully, this is labeled as a \"cron\" message with ID \"review-p-every-10m\". This seems to be an automated system message rather than something needing my immediate action. The HEARTBEAT.md shows a todo for 5:00 PM which isn't due yet.\n\nI should respond with HEARTBEAT_OK since nothing from HEARTBEAT.md needs attention at this time.","thinkingSignature":"25d1c61df01041f482938b39d7ec6e34a0ee3a6c5a41a0cd0207c5ab83ff5a99"},{"type":"text","text":"HEARTBEAT_OK"}],"api":"anthropic-messages","provider":"minimax-portal","model":"MiniMax-M2.5","usage":{"input":12,"output":277,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":7295,"totalTokens":7584,"cost":{"input":0,"output":0,"cacheRead":0,"cacheWrite":0,"total":0}},"stopReason":"stop","timestamp":1771523270341}}
