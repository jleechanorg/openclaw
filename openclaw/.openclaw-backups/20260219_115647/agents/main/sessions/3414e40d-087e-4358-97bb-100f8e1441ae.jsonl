Looking at the context:\n\n1. This is a reminder about a recurring task to call Ghazi\n2. Current time is Thursday, February 19th, 2026 at 7:48 AM\n3. The reminder says \"recurring until ACK\" - meaning it's waiting for acknowledgment\n\nFrom BOOTSTRAP.md context: I don't have a BOOTSTRAP.md file (it says MISSING).\n\nFrom HEARTBEAT.md context:\n```\n## Reminders\n- [ ] 5:00 PM: Review Cindil's cover letter\n```\n\nThis is a different reminder from the one at 5 PM (review Cindil's cover letter). This is a 7:48 AM reminder to call Ghazi.\n\nThe user hasn't sent me this as a regular message - it's coming through as a cron/automated reminder. According to my instructions:\n- \"When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\"\n- But also: \"If the task explicitly calls for messaging a specific external recipient, note who/where it should go instead of sending it yourself.\"\n\nThis reminder is for ME to call Ghazi. It's not asking me to send a message - it's a reminder for the user (or maybe for me to remind the user?). \n\nLooking at the format: \"Reminder: Call Ghazi (recurring until ACK)\" - this seems like it's targeting the human user, not me. I'm an AI assistant - I can't make phone calls. \n\nThis appears to be an automated reminder that would normally go to a human. Since I can't actually make phone calls (and the skill for voice-call exists but this is clearly a reminder, not a request to make a call), I should note this for the user.\n\nActually, wait - let me re-read. This is coming to ME as a cron job. The user set up a reminder. But what should I do with it? \n\n\nI can't place phone calls myself - the reminder is clearly for the human user to take action. I should acknowledge this reminder exists and belongs on their to-do list rather than trying to handle it myself.","thinkingSignature":"56792eae30c136c65df36a64eb07801aee51f0dcbadca56f1e62d5a1e6559eab"},{"type":"text","text":"This is a recurring reminder for you to call Ghazi.
