This seems like a test message or heartbeat poll. Let me check what HEARTBEAT.md says - it's loaded in the context and says to keep it empty or with only comments to skip heartbeat API calls, and if nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\n\nLooking at HEARTBEAT.md from the context:\n\"# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.\n\n# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\"\n\nThere's nothing in HEARTBEAT.md that needs attention - it's just comments. So according to the instructions in MEMORY.md about heartbeats, I should reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\n\nWait, but looking at the runtime info, it says \"capabilities=none\" which might mean this isn't actually a heartbeat. But the user message is literally \"Action 0\" which seems like it could be a test or heartbeat.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at MEMORY.md, the heartbeat instructions say:\n\"If you receive a heartbeat poll (a message matching the heartbeat prompt above), and there is nothing that needs attention, reply exactly: HEARTBEAT_OK\"\n\nThe heartbeat prompt is:\n\"Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.\"\n\nBut the user message is \"Action 0\", not the heartbeat prompt. So this might just be a test message. Let me respond appropriately - since this appears to be a test/E2E scenario based on USER.md (\"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"), I should probably just acknowledge or respond to the action.\n\nGiven it's \"Action 0\" and this is an E2E test context, I'll respond with something simple that acknowledges the action was received.","thinkingSignature":"02c8dc75d03554f4ce177cad1f11c68a545e40b9e7dab7712047281ed2b6986c"},{"type":"text","text":"Action received.
