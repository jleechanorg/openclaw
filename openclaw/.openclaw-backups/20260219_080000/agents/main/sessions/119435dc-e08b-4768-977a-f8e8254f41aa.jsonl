Let me check what's in the workspace to understand what this is about.\n\nLooking at the context, I see:\n- This is a cron job with ID f44e55e8-2af2-4e8a-91c3-4d64842eceb0\n- It's labeled \"review-p-every-10m\" \n- I should check if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to\n\nSince this is a cron (not a heartbeat), and there's no specific context provided about what \"P\" is, I need to figure out what to review. Let me check if there are any files or notes about \"P\" in the workspace.\n\nActually, I don't see any specific information about what \"P\" refers to. The cron reminder seems to be about reviewing something, but without more context, I can't determine what needs to be reviewed.\n\nThis appears to be a test session (from USER.md - \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"). Without knowing what \"P\" refers to, I should acknowledge that I don't have enough context to review anything specific.\n\nWait - let me reconsider. This could be related to the E2E testing context. Perhaps there's something in the test environment that needs reviewing. But without explicit context about what \"P\" is, I should ask for clarification.\n\nActually, since this is a cron job that fires every 10 minutes with no response provided, it seems like this might be a test artifact or the user needs to provide more context about what \"P\" is.","thinkingSignature":"f747c34ee0c0d4ffd9a20c3179d38b86d2fb434811c0428381ba9aa55946ff03"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have enough context to review \"P\" — there's no information in the workspace about what \"P\" refers to. \n\nCould you clarify what needs to be reviewed?
