This seems to be part of a roleplaying game or adventure scenario. Looking at the context, I can see:\n\n1. This is an E2E test for OpenClaw character creation\n2. The previous session mentioned \"browser test character creation for a scholar in a library setting\"\n3. There's a \"runtime\" section showing this is running as an agent\n\nBut wait - there's no actual game state, map, or context about what ruins the user is inspecting. This seems like the user is trying to play a text-based adventure or RPG.\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the context:\n- USER.md says \"Running E2E tests for OpenClaw character creation\"\n- The runtime shows model=minimax-portal/MiniMax-M2.5\n- This appears to be a test scenario\n\nActually, I need to be careful here. The user sent a very short message \"I inspect the ruins for traps\" which seems like they're trying to interact with some kind of game or adventure. But I have no context about:\n- What ruins\n- What game/system\n- What character\n- Any previous state\n\nThis could be:\n1. A test to see how the agent handles game-like interactions\n2. Part of an E2E test for OpenClaw\n3. The user is confused about what this session is for\n\nGiven the test context and that I have no game state, I should probably ask for clarification or indicate I don't have enough context to respond meaningfully to this.\n\nActually, let me reconsider. The system prompt mentions I'm running inside OpenClaw and this is an E2E test. The user might be expecting me to engage in a text adventure or they might be testing something specific.\n\nBut I genuinely have no information about what \"ruins\" they're inspecting. I should ask for clarification.","thinkingSignature":"6ceb4191b8194d0473f7395bfdbe1e107e7a99baf1711c35574df39496de6494"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have any context about what ruins you're inspecting.
