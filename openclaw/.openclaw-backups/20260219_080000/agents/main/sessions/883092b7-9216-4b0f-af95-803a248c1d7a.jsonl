Let me check what's in HEARTBEAT.md or if there's any context about what \"P\" refers to.\n\nLooking at the HEARTBEAT.md from the context, it only has comments saying to keep it empty or with only comments to skip heartbeat API calls. There's no task listed about reviewing \"P\".\n\nThis appears to be a cron job that was set up previously, but the task isn't clearly defined in the current workspace context. Since there's nothing in HEARTBEAT.md about reviewing \"P\", and the reminder seems to be from a previous session that I don't have context for, I should acknowledge but indicate I don't know what \"P\" refers to.\n\nWait - let me check the Silent Replies section. It says \"When you have nothing to say, respond with ONLY: NO_REPLY\". But this isn't really \"nothing to say\" - this is a reminder that I need to understand.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the cron message - it says \"review-p-every-10m\" and \"until ack\". This seems like a task was set up but I don't have context about what \"P\" is. \n\nThe HEARTBEAT.md says: \"Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls. Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.\"\n\nSince HEARTBEAT.md has only comments and no actual tasks about \"P\", this cron might be orphaned or from a previous session. I should ask for clarification about what \"P\" is.\n\nBut wait - the rules say if nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK. But this cron IS asking me to do something - review P. So it's asking for attention.\n\nI don't have enough context to review \"P\" without knowing what it is. I should respond asking for clarification about what \"P\" refers to.","thinkingSignature":"22a63c09686a874e4ce95266ca03b1e40e9439f37a0ad5ad608dd6b459a7acb8"},{"type":"text","text":"I don't have context about what \"P\" refers to.
