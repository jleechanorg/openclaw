Present the character for review since there's a character prompt provided\n2. Use the `[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]` tag\n3. Ask for confirmation or edits\n4. Provide exactly two choices: \"Edit Character\" and \"Finish Character Creation and Start Game\"\n\nThe character prompt gives me: \"A hero\" - so I should generate a character based on this. Let me create a basic hero character for review.\n\nWait, looking more carefully at the instructions - when there's a character_prompt provided, I should use the AI generation approach. Let me create a character and present it for review.\n\nActually, re-reading the instructions for \"God Mode Template Review\" - when there's a pre-populated character. But here there's no pre-populated character in game_state - it's empty. So I should follow the manual creation flow.\n\nBut wait - there's a character_prompt provided. This is different from a fully created character. Let me think about this...\n\nThe character_prompt tells me what kind of character to create: \"A hero\" in \"A small room\"\n\nI should:\n1. Generate a character based on this prompt\n2. Present it for review\n3. Ask if they want to edit or start the game\n\nLet me create a basic hero character - I'll make some assumptions since the prompt is vague (\"A hero\"). I'll create a standard fantasy hero.","thinkingSignature":"a3720aa3e2e23b58da6a207c616d3746d0110b7ef0f7c0458e39760187023310"},{"type":"text","text":"[CHARACTER CREATION - Review]\n\nBased on your prompt \"A hero\" in \"A small room,\" here's the generated character for review:\n\n---\n\n**Name:** Kira Drell  \n**Race:** Human  \n**Class:** Fighter (Champion)  \n**Level:** 1  \n\n**Ability Scores:**\n- STR: 16 (+3)\n- DEX: 14 (+2)\n- CON: 15 (+2)\n- INT: 10 (+0)\n- WIS: 12 (+1)\n- CHA: 13 (+1)\n\n**Combat Stats:**\n- HP: 12/12\n- AC: 18 (Chain Mail + Shield)\n- Initiative: +2\n- Proficiency Bonus: +2\n\n**Equipment:**\n- Chain Mail, Longsword, Shield, 5 Javelins\n- Burglar's Pack\n- 10 gold pieces\n\n**Skills:** Athletics, Intimidation, Survival\n\n**Backstory:** A former city guardsman who left the watch after uncovering corruption.
