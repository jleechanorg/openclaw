I'll have Caelindis react to whatever the player says about their research, setting up the next interaction.\n\nI should NOT request dice rolls for this - it's a simple roleplayed conversation where the player is explaining what they're studying. This isn't a contested check or a high-stakes persuasion attempt yet. The librarian is simply engaging in conversation.\n \nI'll craft a narrative that weaves the player's research explanation into the ongoing dialogue.

Most seekers these days want power, secrets to exploit.\\\" She looks at you anew, her pale eyes narrowing slightly. \\\"But you speak like someone who truly wishes to *understand*.\\\"\\n\\nShe sighs softly, glancing toward the locked iron door on the upper gallery. \\\"The Depository does contain what you seek—fragments of the Loremasters' observations, intercepted communications from the old empires, maps of a world that no longer exists.\\\" Her voice drops. \\\"But also darker things. Summaries of rituals best forgotten. Names that should not be spoken.\\\"\\n\\nCaelindis straightens, her expression becoming more guarded. \\\"I cannot grant access—only the Council can. But...\\\" She hesitates, a flicker of something like memory passing across her face. \\\"If you were to petition them, a letter of endorsement from a recognized scholar would help considerably. There are a few who still hold enough standing.\\\"\\n\\nShe trails off, then adds quietly, \\\"The young man in the corner—Aldric—his father sits on the Council. He's been researching here for months, ever more desperately. I wonder sometimes what he's looking for.\\\"\",\n  \"planning_block\": {\n    \"thinking\": \"Interesting—Caelindis seems to have opened up more after my scholarly explanation.
