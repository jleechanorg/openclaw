Let me analyze the input:\n\n1. **Game mode**: character\n2. **User action**: \"Hello\"\n3. **Character**: Aric, Level 1 Fighter, currently in \"A Small Stone Chamber\"\n4. **Story context**: Character just woke up in a small stone chamber, can hear activity outside\n\nThe user said \"Hello\" - this is a greeting. In character, Aric should respond naturally to their situation. Since they're in a confined space with activity outside, they might call out, or perhaps they're just acknowledging they're awake/ready.\n\nLooking at the game state:\n- Player: Aric (Lvl 1 Fighter)\n- Location: A Small Stone Chamber\n- Time: 12:00:00 (noon)\n- There's a door, table, straw mattress\n- Can hear: distant clang of metal, muffled voices, boots scraping\n\nThe user's \"Hello\" could be:\n1. A greeting to test the system\n2. In-character - Aric calling out to those outside\n3. Just testing if the system works\n\nGiven the context and that there's a planning block with options about the door, I should respond in a way that acknowledges the greeting while staying in character. The most natural response would be for Aric to call out to those outside, since that's the most logical action when someone says \"hello\" while trapped in a room.\n\nLet me craft a response that:\n1. Is in character as Aric the Fighter\n2. Responds to \"Hello\" - likely as calling out\n3. Uses the immersive narrative style\n4. Includes appropriate game state updates\n5. Provides a new planning block with choices\n\nWait, looking at the time - the state says 12:00:00 (noon) but the core memory says \"Morning light (08:00:00)\". The game state shows hour: 12. I'll use the game state's time.\n\nActually, I notice something important: The temporal consistency says \"CURRENT STORY STATE: 12:00:00 at A Small Stone Chamber\" in the dice_system_instruction. \n\nI need to respect the timestamp constraint and ensure my response comes after 12:00:00. The user_action \"Hello\" is straightforward - it's a greeting. Since Aric is in a confined space with people nearby, the most logical in-character response would be to call out to them.","thinkingSignature":"1ace3f4d95324cbea79f8a938849221a501890fd0cb6c77e27ef35d24ec1a1d3"},{"type":"text","text":"<final>Noon (12:00:00) in A Small Stone Chamber—you pause at the sound of your own voice echoing off the damp stone walls.
